Log :

Questions for meeting
1. The image I've used for MoSCoW is the one done at the start of the year, below it I have a table that has additional functional/non-functional requirements added throughout the development. 
2. Research questions
3. Should I be including Developer/Researcher User personas/experiences or does that diverge too far from the project specification?
4. What should I include in the Appendix, is the sci-kit / JSON relevant?
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]**
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
