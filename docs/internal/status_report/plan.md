Log : 
1. ~15hrs Diss. +1600 words, fixed up diagrams, format, tables - linked all the sections throughout, done the same with requirements, research Qs
2. Working with the pandas df's is challenging locally, can clusterise Jupyter but need to import .csv file
2a. Should maybe add more API calls to serve it in components

Questions for meeting
1. The image I've used for MoSCoW is the one done at the start of the year, below it I have a table that has additional functional/non-functional requirements added throughout the development. Should I do this, or just do one table and drop the original graphical representation?
2. Should I be including Developer/Researcher User personas/experiences or does that diverge too far from the project specification?
3. What should I include in the Appendix, is the sci-kit / JSON relevant?
