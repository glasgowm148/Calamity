  abstract = {Microblogging services such as Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare have become major sources for information about real-world events. Most approaches that aim at extracting event information from such sources typically use the temporal context of messages. However, exploiting the location information of georeferenced messages, too, is important to detect localized events, such as public events or emergency situations. Users posting messages that are close to the location of an event serve as human sensors to describe an event. In this demonstration, we present a novel framework to detect localized events in real-time from a Twitter stream and to track the evolution of such events over time. For this, spatio-temporal characteristics of keywords are continuously extracted to identify meaningful candidates for event descriptions. Then, localized event information is extracted by clustering keywords according to their spatial similarity. To determine the most important events in a (recent) time frame, we introduce a scoring scheme for events. We demonstrate the functionality of our system, called EvenTweet, using a stream of tweets from Europe during the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship.},

  abstract = {Social Sensing is based on the idea that communities or groups of people provide a set of information similar to those obtainable from a single sensor. This amount of information generate a complex and adequate knowledge of one or more specific issues. A possible field of application for Social Sensing is Emergency Management. By using the Social Media it is possible to gather updated information about emerging situations of danger, in order to gain greater situational awareness and to alert interested parties promptly or verify information obtained through other channels. A system able to timely detect events that are of social concern can be referred to as an Early Warning system. In this work we propose a novel and general architecture for an early warning system and, as a proof-ofconcept, we describe an implementation of this architecture for a real scenario. We use Twitter as source of information for the detection of earthquakes on the Italian territory. We compare our results with official data provided by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the authority responsible for the monitoring of seismic events in Italy. Results show an high ability of the system in the timely detection of events with magnitude equal or greater than 3.5 Richter with only 10\% of False Positives.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to propose and test a hybrid machine learning pipeline to uncover the unfolding of disaster events corresponding to different locations from social media posts during disasters. Effective disaster response and recovery require a comprehensive understanding of disaster situations, i.e., unfolding of disaster events and geographic distribution of the disruptions. Existing studies have employed machine learning methods to conduct coarse-grained event detection and analyze the geographical location information from geotagged social media data. However, only a very small fraction of the entire set of social media data includes geotagged information, which may not directly correspond to events described in the content of posts. In addition, the coarse-grained information detected by existing approaches is token-based, which does not provide sufficient information for situation awareness. Hence, the detection of location and finer-grained event information could significantly improve the utility, credibility, and interpretability of social media data for situation awareness. To address these limitations, this study proposed a hybrid machine learning pipeline that makes use of all relevant tweets to uncover the evolution of disaster events across different locations. The pipeline integrates Named Entity Recognition for detecting locations mentioned in the posts, location fusion approach to extract coordinates of the locations and remove noise information, finetuned BERT model for classifying posts with humanitarian categories, and graph-based clustering to identify credible situational information. The application of the study is demonstrated using the data set collected from Twitter during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Houston. The results show the capability of the proposed hybrid pipeline for automated mapping of events across time and space from social media posts with considerable accuracy. The findings also suggest that the potential for forensic analysis of disasters using mapped events and their evolution, and based on the variation of social media attention to different locations in disasters. Hence, this method could provide a useful tool to support emergency managers, public officials, residents, first responders, and other stakeholders in rapid situation awareness across time and space.},

Several methods for disaster- and event-related tweet filtering and classification are available to analyse social media streams. Rather than processing single tweets, taking into account space and time is likely to reveal even more insights regarding local event dynamics and impacts on population and environment. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of a generic workflow for Twitter data analysis that leverages that additional information to characterize crisis events more comprehensively. The workflow covers data acquisition, analysis and visualization, and aims at the provision of a multifaceted and detailed picture of events that happen in affected areas. This is approached by utilizing agile and flexible analysis methods providing different and complementary views on the data. Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning and clustering methods, we are interested in the question, whether our workflow is suitable to reconstruct and picture the course of events during major natural disasters from Twitter data. Experimental results obtained with a data set acquired during hurricane Florence in September 2018 demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied methods but also indicate further interesting research questions and directions.},

Looking specifically at Twitter, we see that users may categorize their posts using hashtags, and any word or phrase may be used as the category.

To combat this, we propose, implement and evaluate a tool for suggesting relevant hashtags to a user, given a tweet. Initial analyses suggest our dataset is rich enough to extract informative distributions of words for many hashtags that will facilitate a naive Bayes model for hashtag recommendation given a query post.},

  abstract = {Social media streams, such as Twitter, have shown themselves to be useful sources of real-time information about what is happening in the world. Automatic detection and tracking of events identified in these streams have a variety of real-world applications, e.g. identifying and automatically reporting road accidents for emergency services. However, to be useful, events need to be identified within the stream with a very low latency. This is challenging due to the high volume of posts within these social streams. In this paper, we propose a novel event detection approach that can both effectively detect events within social streams like Twitter and can scale to thousands of posts every second. Through experimentation on a large Twitter dataset, we show that our approach can process the equivalent to the full Twitter Firehose stream, while maintaining event detection accuracy and outperforming an alternative distributed event detection system.},

This initiative advances the state of the art in this area through an evaluation challenge, which attracts researchers and developers from across the globe. The 2018 edition of the track provides a standardized evaluation methodology, an ontology of emergency-relevant social media information types, proposes a scale for information criticality, and releases a dataset containing fifteen test events and approximately 20,000 labeled tweets. Analysis of this dataset reveals a significant amount of actionable information on social media during emergencies ({$>$} 10\%). While this data is valuable for emergency response efforts, analysis of the 39 state-of-the-art systems demonstrate a performance gap in identifying this data. We therefore find the current state-of-the-art is insufficient for emergency responders’ requirements, particularly for rare actionable information for which there is little prior training data available.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of Twitter for research, there are very few publicly available corpora, and those which are available are either too small or unsuitable for tasks such as event detection. This is partially due to a number of issues associated with the creation of Twitter corpora, including restrictions on the distribution of the tweets and the difficultly of creating relevance judgements at such a large scale. The difficulty of creating relevance judgements for the task of event detection is further hampered by ambiguity in the definition of event. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the creation of an event detection corpus. Specifically, we first create a new corpus that covers a period of 4 weeks and contains over 120 million tweets, which we make available for research. We then propose a definition of event which fits the characteristics of Twitter, and using this definition, we generate a set of relevance judgements aimed specifically at the task of event detection. To do so, we make use of existing state-of-the-art event detection approaches and Wikipedia to generate a set of candidate events with associated tweets. We then use crowdsourcing to gather relevance judgements, and discuss the quality of results, including how we ensured integrity and prevented spam. As a result of this process, along with our Twitter corpus, we release relevance judgements containing over 150,000 tweets, covering more than 500 events, which can be used for the evaluation of event detection approaches.},

While topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have a long history of successful application to news articles and academic abstracts, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like Twitter. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve topics learned from Twitter content without modifying the basic machinery of LDA; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data preprocessing step for LDA. We empirically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic coherence across three diverse Twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified LDA baseline and a variety of pooling schemes. An additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further improves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics. Overall, these two novel schemes lead to significantly improved LDA topic models on Twitter content.},

In fact, for English, there is no need to develop tools such as tokenizers, partof-speech (POS) taggers, chunkers or named entity recognizers (NER). The current challenge is to select which one to use, out of the range of available tools. This choice may depend on several aspects, including the kind and source of text, where the level, formal or informal, may influence the performance of such tools. In this paper, we assess a range of natural language processing toolkits with their default configuration, while performing a set of standard tasks (e.g. tokenization, POS tagging, chunking and NER), in popular datasets that cover newspaper and social network text. The obtained results are analyzed and, while we could not decide on a single toolkit, this exercise was very helpful to narrow our choice.},

  abstract = {Social media becomes a vital part in our daily communication practice, creating a huge amount of data and covering different real-world situations. Currently, there is a tendency in making use of social media during emergency management and response. Most of this effort is performed by a huge number of volunteers browsing through social media data and preparing maps that can be used by professional first responders. Automatic analysis approaches are needed to directly support the response teams in monitoring and also understanding the evolution of facts in social media during an emergency situation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of real-time sub-events identification in social media data (i.e., Twitter, Flickr and YouTube) during emergencies. A processing framework is presented serving to generate situational reports/summaries from social media data. This framework relies in particular on online indexing and online clustering of media data streams. Online indexing aims at tracking the relevant vocabulary to capture the evolution of sub-events over time. Online clustering, on the other hand, is used to detect and update the set of sub-events using the indices built during online indexing. To evaluate the framework, social media data related to Hurricane Sandy 2012 was collected and used in a series of experiments. In particular some online indexing methods have been tested against a proposed method to show their suitability. Moreover, the quality of online clustering has been studied using standard clustering indices. Overall the framework provides a great opportunity for supporting emergency responders as demonstrated in real-world emergency exercises.},

Solving the credit attribution problem requires associating each word in a document with the most appropriate tags and vice versa. This paper introduces Labeled LDA, a topic model that constrains Latent Dirichlet Allocation by defining a one-to-one correspondence between LDA’s latent topics and user tags. This allows Labeled LDA to directly learn word-tag correspondences. We demonstrate Labeled LDA’s improved expressiveness over traditional LDA with visualizations of a corpus of tagged web pages from del.icio.us. Labeled LDA outperforms SVMs by more than 3 to 1 when extracting tag-specific document snippets. As a multi-label text classifier, our model is competitive with a discriminative baseline on a variety of datasets.},

The major challenges in achieving such awareness are lack of access to various sources of information and tools. Social media plays a vital role in understanding the real situation at the place of disaster as the information is received directly from the affected people. If the collected information is leveraged effectively, the crisis situation can be brought under control and the risks of the disaster affected people or disaster prone areas are reduced. This indeed minimizes the casualty and helps the affected people in serving with their basic needs and medical emergencies. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for segregating and classifying the texts1 received from the people who are at risk in the affected region. The proposed hybrid method combines rule based methodology and machine learning algorithms with linguistic features for segregating the texts and classifying them according to the needs. The results of the real-time text classification algorithm help the emergency responders to locate the people at risk and reach them during the hour of their need.},

Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and online help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them. During emergency events, individuals are exposed to large quantities of information without being aware of their validity or risk of misinformation, but users are usually swift to correct them, thus making the social media “self-regulating”.},

  abstract = {Journalists, emergency responders, and the general public use Twitter during disasters as an effective means to disseminate emergency information. However, there is a growing concern about the credibility of disaster tweets. This concern negatively influences Twitter users’ decisions about whether to retweet information, which can delay the dissemination of accurate—and sometimes essential—communications during a crisis. Although verifying information credibility is often a time-consuming task requiring considerable cognitive effort, researchers have yet to explore how people manage this task while using Twitter during disaster situations.},

  abstract = {Social media such as Twitter has come to reflect the reaction of the general public to major events. Since posts are short and noisy, it is hard to extract reliable events based on word frequency. Even though an event term appears in a particularly low frequency, as long as at least one reliable user mentions the term, it should be extracted. This paper proposes an event extraction method which combines user reliability and timeline analysis. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is adapted with the weights of event terms on timeline and reliable users to extract social events. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users and active users. Reliable and low-frequency events can be detected based on reliable users In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a Korean tweet collection; the proposed model achieved 72\% in precision. This shows that the LDA with timeline and reliable users is effective for extracting events on the Twitter test collection.},

Design:\hspace{0.6em} This study uses content analysis of more than 80 related journal articles, research reports, and government documents as well as more than 120 newspaper articles, identified through LexisNexis search queries. Results:\hspace{0.6em}Three strategies, information dissemination, monitoring real-time data, and engaging the public in a conversation and/or crowdsourcing, are available to emergency managers to augment communication practices via face-to-face contact and through traditional media outlets. Academic research has identified several message types disseminated during response operations.1,2 Message types during other emergency phases have received less attention; however, news reporting and government reports provide best practices and inform this study. This article provides the foundation for a more complete typology of emergency management messages. Relatedly, despite limited attention in the academic research, monitoring social media feeds to accrue situational awareness and interacting with others to generate a conversation and/or to coordinate collective action also take place in various forms and are discussed. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em}Findings integrate the fragmented body of knowledge into a more coherent whole and suggest that practitioners might maximize outcomes through a three-step process of information dissemination, data monitoring, and the direct engagement of diverse sets of actors to spur risk reduction efforts. However, these steps require time, personnel, and resources, which present},

  abstract = {The Four Phase Model of Emergency Management has been widely used in developing emergency/disaster response plans. However, the model has received criticism contrasting the clear phase distinctions in the model with the complex and overlapping nature of phases indicated by empirical evidence. To investigate how phases actually occur, we designed PhaseVis based on visualization principles, and applied it to Hurricane Isaac tweet data. We trained three classification algorithms using the four phases as categories. The 10-fold cross-validation showed that Multi-class SVM performed the best in Precision (0.8) and Naïve Bayes Multinomial performed the best in F-1 score (0.782). The tweet volume in each category was visualized as a ThemeRiver™, which shows the ‘What’ aspect. Other aspects - 'When', 'Where', and 'Who' - are also integrated. The classification evaluation and a sample use case indicate that PhaseVis has potential utility in disasters, aiding those investigating a large disaster tweet dataset.},
