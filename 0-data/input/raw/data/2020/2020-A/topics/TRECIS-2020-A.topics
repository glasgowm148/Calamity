<narr> A strong earthquake on Friday shook
Athens and the entire Attica region. The tremor was estimated to measure
5.1 on the Richter scale after an initial estimate of 5.3 by the US
Geological Survey. The epicenter was 23 km north-west of the capital, 12
km deep, considered superficial, therefore felt more strongly.

<title>2019 Hurricane Barry</title>
<type>typhoon</type>
<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Barry_(2019)</url>
<narr> Hurricane Barry was an unusually asymmetrical Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Louisiana in July 2019. Barry originated as a mesoscale convective vortex 
over the midwestern United States on July 2. The system eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 10, whereupon the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated 
it as a potential tropical cyclone later. Early on July 11, the system developed into a tropical depression and later tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of 
the annual hurricane season. On July 13, Barry attained maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 993 millibars (29.3 inHg), 
becoming the first hurricane of the season. Later that day, Barry made landfall on Marsh Island and Intracoastal City, Louisiana both times as a Category 1 hurricane, 
subsequently weakening to tropical storm status. Late on July 15, Barry degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas, before dissipating on July 19.

<narr> Authorities in Papua New Guinea have dispatched teams in the Pacific island nation's New Britain province to monitor remote communities for casualties and assess 
the extent of damage after a powerful, shallow earthquake rattled coastal towns. The magnitude 7.5 offshore tremor struck around 50km east of the main city of Rabaul at 
a depth of around 10km just before 11pm on Tuesday (13:00 GMT), according to the United States Geological Survey

<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Pacific_typhoon_season#Typhoon_Krosa</url>
<narr> A tropical depression formed near Mariana Islands on August 5. By August 6, it intensified into a tropical storm, and was named Krosa by the JMA. Tropical Storm Krosa 
soon became a typhoon, and rapidly intensified to become a category 3-equivalent typhoon on August 8. Upwelling of cooler waters induced weakening thereafter; by August 13, 
Krosa weakened below typhoon intensity. Krosa continued moving, albeit slowly, towards Japan with little change in intensity. On August 11 Krosa expanded into 950-miles (1,600 km) 
in diameter giant storm. Moderately conducive conditions were unable to aid Krosa in strengthening, and it stayed the same intensity before landfall in Japan. On August 14, 
Krosa emerged in the Sea of Japan and a few days later on August 16 Krosa transitioned into an extratropical low.

<narr> Typhoon Lekima, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Hanna, was the second costliest typhoon in Chinese history behind Typhoon Fitow of 2013.[1] The ninth named storm of 
the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Lekima originated from a tropical depression that formed east of the Philippines on July 30. It gradually organized, became a tropical storm, 
and was named on August 4. Lekima intensified under favourable environmental conditions and peaked as a Category 4â€“equivalent super typhoon. However, an eyewall replacement 
cycle caused the typhoon to weaken before it made landfall in Zhejiang late on August 9, as a Category 2â€“equivalent typhoon. Lekima weakened subsequently while moving across 
Eastern China, and made its second landfall in Shandong on August 11.

<url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddbrook_Reservoir</url>
<narr> On 1 August 2019, a major incident was declared and 1,500 residents were evacuated from parts of Whaley Bridge, Furness Vale and New Mills after concrete slabs on the 
1969 overflow spillway were partially dislodged by high volumes of water following several days of heavy rain.[13][14][15] The Environment Agency issued a 'danger to life' 
warning due to the possibility of the dam collapsing. High-volume pumps were deployed to take water from the reservoir to prevent it from overflowing and reduce pressure on 
the dam. An RAF Chinook helicopter dropped 400 tonnes of aggregate into the damaged area and specialist contractors added concrete grouting between the bags of ballast 
to bind them together to support the spillway.
