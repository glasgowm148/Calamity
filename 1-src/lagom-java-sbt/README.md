You can verify that the services are indeed up and running by invoking the hello service endpoint 

http://localhost:9000/api/hello/World

* Service interface > eris/api/ErisService.java
  * > The source file defining a service interface belongs in the service’s api project. 
    > For example, in Hello World, HelloService.java, the source file for the hello service interface
    > resides in the hello-api directory of the Maven project or sbt build.
* Service implementation  > eris/impl/ErisServiceImpl.java
  * > The related impl directory contains the implementation of the service interface’s abstract methods. 
    For instance, HelloServiceImpl.java in the hello-impl directory implements the hello service HelloService.hello method. 
    > The service implementation uses a (sharded)[https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/typed/cluster-sharding.html#introduction],
