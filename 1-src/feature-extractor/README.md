# TweetMinner

This project is based on PlayFramework, a full-stack reactive framework for the JVM. Project focus on applying concepts such as functional programming, lambdas, streams, asynchronous programming with futures, and actor-based programming, in the context of a web application. This application fetched tweets from twitter.com using twitter4j API, based on the search keyword entered by the user. It also has other features like searching for tweets with respect to geolocation, hashtags, etc. Even the user profile can be displayed. Moreover, complex operations like sentiment analysis and counting words can also be performed.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). 

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.
