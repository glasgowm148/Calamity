Hierarchical Event Detection and Clustering in Micro-Blogs using Topic Models
===

This repository contains the code that we wrote for doing our Bachelor's Thesis Project.

Link to the final report - [here](https://github.com/harshil93/BTP/blob/master/Report-II/report.pdf)

The code is not well documented.
It used a lot of different components from various libraries and was meant only for prototyping the work.

If anyone finds this helpful and want to use it, he/she have the consent to use it in any way.
