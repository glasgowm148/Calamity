10	2015-03-03 00:00:00	The bomb was hidden under a car parked near the high court — the country's highest criminal court — and went off in Cairo's Ramses neighborhood. The area is very crowded, with dozens of street vendors selling their ware on stalls set up on the asphalt. Nearby are several bus stops, a railway station and a subway station.  Egyptian private The Seventh Day TV broadcast footage of the site, showing hundreds of onlookers around cars with smashed windows and blood on the pavement. Police cordoned off the area and state TV later reported that a second bomb was dismantled before it went off.  The interior ministry and the health ministry earlier had said no one was killed, despite a previous state TV report mentioning that one person died. The wounded included seven policemen, the health ministry said.

34	2015-02-07 00:00:00	See John 1:1-14  You may search the internet for that.  The WORD OF GOD IS JESUS CHRIST, who is God (or else it is impossible for him to do what he did on earth.)  He existed from eternity past and will continue to eternity future.  Man sinned, so man had to pay for his sins, but man cannot.. So God became a man to make it possible for man to pay. But God paid only for the elect of God, and not for every human being.. Who those are is God's business.  Would you be happy if God did not pay for anybody?

46	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It is wrong to say that rape culture is common. A rape is a rape anywhere in the world.

52	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What an idiot.
53	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Incorrect. There is nothing even resembling an acceptance or normalization of rape in Italy. In fact, it is very harshly punished.  What we have is not a rape culture, but a "false rape accusation culture," where false accusations are often rewarded, rarely punished, and never punished severely.

82	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Indians are born corrupted there's no doubt about it. the few good ones are tormented by their evil seniors. india can never change its deep rooted into their blood stream. cheating, lying, robbing, raping, murdering extortion, fake goods, prostitution, money laundering, drugs, etc etc its like their daily life style. india is on a verge of total destruction, india is on a verge of a collapse. no point of return. the people live in denial.    there is no hope in india. its controlled by the mafia politicians. all indian politicians are illiterate goons who join politic for their own gain. they are not least bothered about the common people. its time for civil war, every state for its self. modi the c h u t is only focusing on the hijras state gujarat. its a fact. throw all gujjus from all the other states even the sindhis, these two are the suckers
83	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Rightly said.
84	2015-03-06 00:00:00	How convenient to make sweeping statements?. Go to authentic sites giving info in public domain. India has the lowest incidence of rapes (reported as well as unreported). in the world in spite of being the second largest populated country. So are the other crime rates.  It is people like you obliterating the truth by projecting a few incidents here and there and tarnish the image. What you call bribery in India is respectable elsewhere under the name 'tip'.  Your self-righteous attitude make me like vomiting.
85	2015-03-06 00:00:00	dont get frustrated about it. the situation is bad but not hopeless. all this is the result of misgovernance of previous regimes. when the country is not developed according to its needs, desperation and hopelessness sets in youth and they take to crime. that is the case in all underdeveloped countries. that is why we need to support the development at any cost. for the sake of our next generations. many political parties have come luring poor, innocent and illeterate public with freebies and false promises, all of them looted this country. many more such parties will come in future as long as the people are illiterate and innocent and divided. at least the educated section of the public should show maturity and understand the need for development. I am more worried when people of delhi who are supposed to be very educated voted overwhelmingly for freebie promises and rejected the development agenda. that is a bigger cause of worry for me. that tells me this country is still not ready to move forward, that tell me that we have not learnt anything from our past mistakes. that tell me our youth is still not ready to work hard but more interested in freebies. that is a big big concern.
86	2015-03-07 00:00:00	always blame previous , blame the British, Blame this or that
87	2015-03-08 00:00:00	YES  AGREE TO SOME EXTENT BUT DON'T BLAME ANY ONE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD PEOPLE IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND ALL RELIGIONS.

95	2015-03-06 00:00:00	So instead of punishing the rapist, you stone the woman? Sharia law is the most perverse law and a curse on all women. This is the law that rapists and sexually frustrated men would love to have.
96	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I say  destroy the root of sharia from the face of thisearth

100	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They are not only incompetent    they have double standard some Times no STANDARDS. If the case is of powerfull and in particular if it relates to JUDGES no enquiry / slow enquiry / give reasons that the concerning judges no more a judge etc. and exonorate him / her.

103	2015-03-06 00:00:00	exactly. you have put it very nicely.
104	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It is still wrong to take law into your own hands. In a democracy, an accused must have his day in court. This here is nothing but the law of the jungle. In a scenario like this, people can make false accusations against a person they don't like and incite the mob to exact revenge.
105	2015-03-06 00:00:00	yeah. but tell that to an angry mob. be my guest.
106	2015-03-06 00:00:00	There is a limit to everything even in a democracy!
107	2015-03-06 00:00:00	very true its seems democracy has worked very well for criminals. So the retaliation will take place. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
108	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Problem is that he gets not a day but several years in court! Endless sequence of appeals and stays, if you are influential and/or rich.
109	2015-03-06 00:00:00	And also bail to roam free. One woman came on NDTV recently to say after 10 years the hearing has been started. She was raped when 13 years. The person who did it was released on bail and now married with 2 children.
110	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What use is democracy if it fails to protect us - the law abiding citizens? No one could have known what had happened to this girl unless this criminal was killed.
111	2015-03-06 00:00:00	agreeed
112	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Pls wake up. There's something called medical and circumstantial evidence. 4000 people are not fools to punish a criminal with repeated criminal records of the same kind. Public execution is the right step to wean away such elements from the society as law is helpless to provide justice.
113	2015-03-06 00:00:00	For the first time I must say, I agree with your comments here completely. And this is what happen, when feminist hysteria takes control of emotional brain of critical number of people in any society.

117	2015-03-06 00:00:00	if it is our daughter ur statement is same.
118	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Don't make the same statements again and again. Use your head. A mob cannot think and if thinks move like this , then this will be a regular affair and the country will descend into chaos. What we need is quick action by the courts
119	2015-03-06 00:00:00	In India law is blind. Mukesh sing rapist gives interview. Criminal got glamourised  while no respect  or justice given to India's brave heart. speak to any psychologist they will tell this interviewer will and is giving triggers and anxiety attacks to many rape victim survivors.. Film maker did not address the issue but focusssed on TRP.  In US government has major cover up on many issues reason they give  is mass paranoia so this greedy film maker targets who she can. I have watched satyamevjayete that has covered and addressed the issues. There should more shows like that.
120	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You are right to a large extent. But when judiciary is very very slow  in deciding the case and many a times justice itself is not delivered as culprit manages to manipulate the things in his favor using his money power or other influence, what do you suggest common public should do?
121	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Till the judges daughter gets raped things move fast . Did anyone see the movie " Lawrence of Arabia". Lawrence is riding a slow camel and complains to the mahut . The mahut shoves a stick into the camels rectum and the camel moves very fast. That's what you need to do. A lot of fathers carry guns ,and shoot thier daughters rapist or wife's rapist.
122	2015-03-06 00:00:00	ou are right, but that's not true in India..see what is happen in Uber rape case..a serial rapist,making courts run his ways..
123	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If there is no justice for the victim whose name will be degraded instead, then this is what will happen in the days to come. You cannot expect limitless patience from the people.
124	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Is it fashionable to the Judiciary to drag cases for 10-15 years ?. Is that is justice. There is a famous saying " Justice delayed is Justice denied". The Judiciary has lost its relevance in India. Period.
125	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It is not fashionable only for the Judiciary to drag cases for 10-15 years. Go to any court and check how many false cases are filed, which increases the load on judiciary. By your logic of fast and cruel revengeful justice, you are supporting the lynching mob activity. You rightly said "Justice delayed is Justice denied". But you probably haven't heard of the adage that :Justice hurried is Justice buried". So a balance is what we need to seek as a society not swinging pendulum from one extreme to other. Don't know which extreme is worse. So just cautioning. Because the fire that has spread fast post Dec 16 2012, might soon consume the harmony that is still their between the genders in India.
126	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So if I ask for a justice within a year is too hasty or two years is too hasty according to you. Ruchika case lingered around for 13 years and after conviction what happened. But the girl lost her life. Here too these beasts ra ped and then killed a girl in one of the heinous way. They inserted metal rod in her private parts, they inserted hand and pulled out her parts of intestine from a living person. Does that not matters you. When you have all the evidence and there is no doubt about the criminal act, what you are waiting for. I have 3 sisters, 2 daughters,2 S-I-L, a wife. Chill passes through my spine when I re-visit this case. I have cancelled by vacations in India. I carry hidden weapons when I travel. I agree if there are any doubtful case, but not to delay any straight forward cases. I do not agree with your argument.
127	2015-03-06 00:00:00	if the courts s are so loaded then how do cases of politicians, rich and famous people taken up quickly where it favors them,
128	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You are right!  Splitting of Reliance Industries between two brothers was heard on daily basis and case was settled and closed in record time - why and how court found time to hear that case daily?
129	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Some of these judges should be dragged out too and given a thrashing. Let tghem come to their senses. They can hear Jayalalitha's or some politicians or a rich tycoons case but they have no time for Nirbhaya.Years have gone but it still is to be heard let alone completed.
130	2015-03-06 00:00:00	which court u are referring here to ? Does India have a running court? AND ONE MORE THING.... how would u bring 10000 people together in a false accusation scenario ??? i dnt knw should i laugh at ur logic or jst roll over
131	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The worry is that we have people (authorities) in the system that can mock and play with judiciary. Such instances could create civil disobedience.
132	2015-03-06 00:00:00	haha this coming from MAXX who himself lives in the jungle of rapists called america
133	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The criminal who has been killed in this case is a Bangladeshi, as seen in some news channels. They are mostly involved in gruesome crimes. The Indian government should check these infiltrators and not waste their time after such illegal immigrants.
134	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Hey, This is India, Would those innocents killed in fake encounters had a day in court? India rather awarded those killers  PM position(s). In this case there is nothing to complain.
135	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Do not bring in your Muslim logic here. You got what you sow. Go to Pakistan if it pains you so much.
136	2015-03-06 00:00:00	India is not a democracy. People vote for religion and caste. It's not secular either. Everyone is just so used to and okay with corruption.
137	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You make a valid point but this was hardly a false accusation and if the law is not being applied to prosecute rapists, there IS no justice.India has the death penalty option for convicted rapists but its deterrent value is non existent as the penalty is never applied. You have a group,of four males in prison now that have been sentenced to death for the rape and vicious murder of a young girl in September 2013. They are still alive, stealing our oxygen and getting free food and accommodation courtesy of the tax payer.
138	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Hit on the spot! Thank you.
139	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Now, it is Delhi peoples to storm into Tihar &amp; Beat Nirbhaya rapists into deat!! Judiciary is loosing it's value very badly. Hope our Judiciary take a note of this incident to become active.
140	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Absolutely right!!! Rapists deserve this. Did this happen after India's daughter release on BBC. If yes then BBC has done a good job.
141	2015-03-06 00:00:00	How do we know if he is even a rapist or not ?
142	2015-03-06 00:00:00	yeah ! people are not fools like the CONgress party. A small state where everything is known to each other. Despite having a number of tribes they are a unified people and know everything. just try it yourself at least once ! Bye !!
143	2015-03-06 00:00:00	We will never know that, reason our police is corrupt. Judiciary has lot of patience !! If, this fellow allowed to live, the final judgement will be delivered by supreme court of India at his age of 95. How you will punish him after arresting at this age. govt will admit him in good hospital at this age once arrested. Good that, he god killed. May be barbaric. But, it is failure of our policing, Judiciary...
144	2015-03-06 00:00:00	i hope he was the guilty man...this is where mob rule and violence can go terribly wrong for innocent people.
145	2015-03-06 00:00:00	ONE ODD WRONG IS ACCEPTED... ALL ESCAPE IDEAS
146	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People are not fools. Do not judge people. They are the once who vote to make govt and they are the once who break govt.
147	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Did we ever care whether those killed in fake encounters were terrorists?
148	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They deserve it. Those anti-national elements should be eliminated from this face of this earth. Even you who are anti-national mind set should leave India if you are so much worried for you brothers who create problems in this country.
149	2015-03-06 00:00:00	That there is a million dollar question. That's why it is so important that people should never take law into their own hands. We have police and judiciary for that. We have a constitution and duly established laws that gover our lives. No doubt justice often moves at snail's pace, but taking laws into our own hands can result in an innocent being killed. laws are designed to protect the innocents as well as to punish the guilty.
150	2015-03-06 00:00:00	"Punish the guilty". Since 2012 not one criminal sentenced to death has been hanged in India. The Supreme Court is clearly ignoring laws passed in Parliament and setting its own standards. If the laws are unconstitutional, the SC should strike them down. But not allowing the punishment of those that have been tried and sentenced is a travesty of justice and this is the result. I am not surprised at all that mob justice is slowly taking root in India. The judiciary has to wake up and see the writing on the wall.
151	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Very true.
152	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Wow, Finally Indian voters got wisdom after electing fake encounter gang to power.
153	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Can women carry guns in India I wonder. Are Indians allowed to carry concealed weapons . The Rapists friend in the Delhi rape could have defended him self . I carry a licensed  Weapon at all times in the USA, there are many weirdos here too. I feel so bad for the poor Indian women. In the USA society is pro woman , hope it can be in India too , that's why you want all this to come out
154	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good natural justice by public. Same should happen with BBC persons.
155	2015-03-06 00:00:00	why not chaddi rapiest and include you. india will better without low pig like you for sure
156	2015-03-06 00:00:00	noncens. do u think they spent the day watching BBC documentary? and this happnd yesterday. abt the same time as the documentary was released
157	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I dont think you read my comments properly.
158	2015-03-06 00:00:00	'My Lords' lost Income of 10 years....
159	2015-03-06 00:00:00	True... This was to happen... Jail term is not sufficient.. Juvenile is bullsshit...
160	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes sir I agree and hope we see more of this. Acts such as this will deter Rapists-GOOD JOB NAGALAND WE ARE PROUD OF YOU!!
161	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Gangajal 2
162	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Right....We should feel guilty that our income tax money is spent on feeding of rapist in jail....Killing of rapist should be followed in all the corners of India...
163	2015-03-06 00:00:00	No mercy to such acts and this will instil fear amongst perpetrators of such claim.
164	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is warning to judiciary . If you people continue to do injustice , enjoy on taxpayers money without accountability, have double standerds morover sometimes no STANDERDS , now it is enough. The days are not far off this may happen in Delhi
165	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Completely agree with you.. I dont understand why it takes so long to hang these rapists when crime is proved against them..
166	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Nonsense. It's what happens when people fail to understand the nature of due process, that false rape accusations are all too common, and the presumption of innocence.  Going by even prejudiced studies the mob had a one in ten chance of beating an innocent man to death. Unprejudiced studies suggest a three to five out of ten chance they killed an innocent.
167	2015-03-06 00:00:00	excellent step taken by the mass.....I appreciate it....this should happen more frequently across the nation so that our police/courts can understand the pain of the common people
168	2015-03-06 00:00:00	But how come that they have broken the central jail     ?This is simply Naxsilite act
169	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I do not understand why the Nirbhaya rape killers are still not hanged. They delivered speedy justice but his conviction has not yet executed because of the stay by the court. People want instant justice in such cases.
170	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I agree with you and the justice is already delivered in Nirbhaya's case. but in case of execution, the courts always take time and should take time to make sure nothing went wrong in the process and all the possible evidence was carefully considered. it is a non reversible decision and life of every person is equal for justice.
171	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Your thinking is fully responsible for delay in hanging of rapists.
172	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Maybe they can be transferred to Dimapur where instant justice will be meted out..
173	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Your thinking is fully responsible for delay in hanging of rapists.
174	2015-03-06 00:00:00	why dont you understand the judges are more responsible for delivering justice than you.
175	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If that is the case, why India has the maximum number of pending cases. There is no ownership and responsibility when they know very well that justice delayed is justice denied
176	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I agree with you on other arguments about our justice system. I am not at all happy with our justice system. but that is for a separate debate. I am only saying that the hanging of any person can not be rushed, because it is an irreversible action. tomorrow if you know you missed to consider some evidence or circumstances, you can not undo the decision.
177	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I TELL YOU GET THOSE TOP WELL TRAINED HINDU LAWYERS FROM US JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND GET ADVICE. THERE AREA FEW INDIAN CHRISTIAN LAWEIERS TOO
178	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They enjoy their Lal Bhatti etc, jail those who dare to question them and fade away. Wishing one senior team comes together to implement 3 shift system and streamline responsible process to deliver judgement without cursory postponements and make themselves accountable for delays. This alone can clear the pending cases.
179	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Vote bank politics.
180	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They are not hanged because, they should be made to accept that what they have made was a crime. Thats why a little bit of torture before death. If hanged immediately, they will not feel pain of Nirbaya underwent. The criminal should get pain before death. Same happened in case of Afzal guru and Kasab.
181	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yeah in fact they should fix a date for these people to hang and just at the last moment postpone it to a different date. Let them die many times. More than death its the fear of death that tortures a person.
182	2015-03-06 00:00:00	the case is in SC I think
183	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They are dying everyday. Imagine who had been sentenced to death and expecting his death any moment what his mental situation will be.
184	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I guess some ministers have "interests" in making a few more documentaries. Even though it was Cong originally it but BJP quickly "shared" "interests". After all earning foreign currency is involved!
185	2015-03-06 00:00:00	That agood and truthful posting. BJP cannot shift the blame entirely to congress. They were in the know..
186	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Courts are dependent on lawyers and lawyers will do almost anything to delay justice.
187	2015-03-06 00:00:00	correction will do anything for money. remember how the defendant who fought for the rapists commented blaming nirbhaya???
188	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You are right about crooked and ugly minded lawyers.Even the bar council of India is protecting them.How can justice be expedited in India.The entire system is doomed and we heading for mob-justice.Conditions are reminiscent of the year 1789 in France and similar consequences are inevitable.
189	2015-03-06 00:00:00	They should not be hanged!!! they must be stoned to death in public at the same place where they did the crime.
190	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Our courts are pro-criminals and politicians.
191	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Why spend two words: criminals should be enough (since the word includes politicians).
192	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Agree. They should be hanged asap.
193	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Cong signed and BJP ratified 100 documentaries on them, one per year.
194	2015-03-06 00:00:00	PORR Rule of Law . The Police need to be educated and  disciplinesd and the courts just . After 70 years Indians ( We ) cannot blame the british
195	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When a country employs people on reservations this is the end result... In all aspects of society...
196	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I feel really bad for poor Indians that suffered much for 1000 years and yet cannot enjoy freedom. There should be a revolution like in China over 70 years ago to cull off the entrenched goodnas . Now we are placing Congress Goondas by BJP goondas, and all I hear is religious Chants. Sadly the country has this historic problem of back ward Muslims who refuse to move beyond the extremism if Koran
197	2015-03-06 00:00:00	We are not surprised at all! Indian people have lost their faith in Indian justice systems and they have no faith in law and order either! Rapists, murderers and all kinds of criminals are being protected by the thug and rogue politicians in India and we the people have to give the similar justice to all rogue and dirty vote bank politicians first and only then, the crime rates will fall and people will live in peace!  Rogue politicians of all parties are India's main problems ailing the nation very badly and people must lynch them first.
198	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You summed up very well. Well done
199	2015-03-06 00:00:00	BUT NOW, POLICE WILL BE IN ACTION TRYING TO FIND AND CATCH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS GOOD THING.
200	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People of Nagaland have shown the way, rest of the country will follow them. Murders happen everyday and murderers are acquitted due to insufficient proof and the case is closed. Why does the court not punish police for not providing the sufficient proof? Case should not be closed till the murderer is found.
201	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People are loosing faith in Government, the police and most of all the judiciary. Judiciary which is supposed to take care of the weak and poor has become a stooge of the rich and powerful. Supreme Cour has time to hear cases of BCCI , Salman  Khan , Priya Pillai , and all bail applications of rich criminals but has no time to hear the case of Nirbhaya rapists and give the final judgment. If this continues the. God forbid people will take law I their hands and serve instant justice as in this case . It will be a sad day for the country of anarchy and chaos will be the only way to getting justice. As it is Naxals have left the path of law  and have become law unto themselves and have proved to be big headache, and if people follow the same , we are doomed.
202	2015-03-06 00:00:00	yeah very true
203	2015-03-05 00:00:00	a million thumbs up to your comment.
204	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes ,even if it not proper.
205	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Rightly said. None of the Govts. does enough in this matter. None of them.
206	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Mob has given instant justice on the eve of women's day which is lot better than hypocritic BBC airing rapist Mukesh view on women's eve for sensationalism and painting entire India as rapists.BBC will be made to pay heavily by India soon.
207	2015-03-06 00:00:00	NB! CON &amp; BJP PEOPLE! You have succeeded  in stopping the documentary India's Daughter in India. I have seen it on you tube &amp; now I know the truth. You are not banning it because it will shame India. You are banning it because it will shame  CON, BJP and those who r your faces. Your parties is full of people with primitive views about women &amp; think that they should be controlled &amp; kept under your thumb of men &amp; that moral policing should be done on them. You are afraid that the documentary will expose your archaic mind set. You have already shown your 18th century mind set by banning the documentary. You also support the use of police to violently stop the genuine &amp; legitimate protests by the citizens. The documentary shows very graphically how unarmed women are being mercilessly beaten by the Delhi Police by batons and water cannons. It is you who should be ashamed of yourselves for your rotten mind set. Get civilized &amp; refined at least now! It is 2015.
208	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You have already mentioned CON, BJP, then Who is 'You' ?
209	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I would be fully convinced that BBC and Leslee Udwin actually care about the issue when they start to clean their own house. They protect several rapists like Raymond Varley in Britain,  then use an incident in India to make themselves popular... that is how it looks like so far......
210	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Hello, have you see the film ? What it depicts is the bare fact of our country. Women are unsafe period ! Jai Hind
211	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Let Leslee udwin produce a documentary on how she become a shameless creature like this and how people like Diana influenced her in becoming a "public property"
212	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This was hardly an "incident". The gang rape and murder took place in September 2013 and the guilty are still languishing in jail awaiting execution.Banning the documentary in India and putting pressure on You Tube to remove the video was rank stupidity by Indian politicians. If you want a book to become a best seller, get it banned. Same with a movie or documentary. The documentary has now become a "best seller" on the internet and in the Western and Asian media courtesy of the ban. Japan has just issued a travel advisory warning to its citizens with regard to India after yet another female Japanese tourist was gang raped about three weeks ago. The Australian government also has the same travel warning in place. And we have our fair share of rapists. But justice is swift in Australia and ruthless. Gang rapes are rare in  Australia and we do not have the death penalty. We will arrest, try the case in a matter of weeks or months and lock you up for 30 to 35 years. That is a very long time for a 17 or 18 year old to rot in jail.
213	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Sorry! until the convicted westeren pedophiles who have been convicted in India and are now hiding in their own countries are allowed to be punished I am not convinced...  Wash your own bag of dirty laundry before jumping over to somebody else's house or country and saying " your laundry is dirty"  If you feel women are unsafe in India make sure they are safe in your own country set an example for the entire world to follow then only it makes sense...
214	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well said. Modi has no daughters so he does not care. He has also treated his wife very badly. He has the RSS BJP ind set that women are a compulsory eveil..
215	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You are talking about MK Gandhi? the bill fits..
216	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am a staunch BJP supporter. That is the reason I am a BIGOT and hate evrey other community. I think that whatever I say is right and all others are wrong. I only have the right to exist and all others do not have any rights. I ama BJP supporter. It is only because of supporters like me that BJP won the election.
217	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what happens in uncivilized systems.
218	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When leaders fail to address social problems ..   something will always break .
219	2015-03-05 00:00:00	LET US THANK OUR JOKEPAL &amp; LOOTPAL CON, BJP &amp; ALLIES THAT HAVE MADE IT ALL PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE VIA WHAT THEY DID 24-7 1947-2015!
220	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What has your comment got to do with this article? Do you have mental issues?
221	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Ignore this guy.. He is on AAP salary
222	2015-03-06 00:00:00	RANTING &amp; RAVING! BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEGA RAPISTS &amp; SUPER CRIMINALS BEHIND THIS CRIMINAL? HOW ABOUT THE ULTRA THUGS WHO MAKE IT PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE FOR THESE CRIMES TO BE PERPETRATED? WHEN WILL THE GOOD BBC EXPOSE THEM &amp; THEREBY SAVE OUR INDIA &amp; INDIANS FROM THEIR OPPRESSION 24-7 1947-2015?
223	2015-03-05 00:00:00	For God sake, can you please stop this nonsense??? You need some urgent psychiatric help.
224	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Peek at Nair - please do not waste your time on Srikumar Hariharan - he is an anti national Indian or perhaps a Pakistani Pig hiding behind a Hindu name. Just ignore him
225	2015-03-06 00:00:00	he he no amount of psychatric help can save him. his condition is an incurable AAPtardism.
226	2015-03-06 00:00:00	he is a fake id cutlet; brainwashed and out from SIMI junkyard
227	2015-03-06 00:00:00	so you chaddi filth.. blind brainwashed brainless filth. you andd mus bro perfect match lol
228	2015-03-06 00:00:00	ONLY A JOKER CAN SEE JOKEPAL AND LOOTPAL AND KEEP REPOSTING SAME COMMENTS TO SATISFY HIMSELF
229	2015-03-05 00:00:00	What did the BJP to ammend that since they have come to power... And now they want to ban the video... The truth hurts... And they want to hide the facts from the world about Indian culture and heritage...
230	2015-03-06 00:00:00	A court which acts independent of Govt has put a restraint on airing the Doc...BBC must respect our judiciary system and once everything was clear they could have aired it...BBC has broken a law of our country...they are not allowed to air such Doc's on their own citizens but they take pleasure in breaking our law's. I have seen the video and I like it, but I would have appreciated if BBC waited until they got permission from our courts.
231	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Court did not order Rajnath singh to attempt banning the documentary worldwide. Indian courts do not attempt to claim jurisdiction worldwide
232	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Are you speaking of the same courts that allow a lawyer to degrade Indian Women... In that case kangaroo courts are better... At least in a banana republic
233	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The documentary was not released for broadcast in india. It was released in the UK. for those in india who watched it probably broke the law, but for the rest of the free world its just called Freedom of Speach
234	2015-03-06 00:00:00	watching the documentary is not breaking the law. I urge everyone in this comment section to watch it .
235	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I live in UK and I too have watched it...I've been here since 14 yrs and I know for a fact that even in UK there is nothing called absolute Freedom of speech...If the incident happened in UK (and believe me there are many worse cases here) BBC would not get permission to even make this Doc. this is precisely why BBC chose to film in India.
236	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I can say the same stands for the USA. Have you ever seen a documentary on the serial killers with a title "Children of America."
237	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well said!
238	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Just because no net works ever did that, doesn't mean the government is behind that !  By far, American press enjoys more freedoms than any other country in the world.
239	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes, you need to read a lot of news before getting a fair idea of the facts.
240	2015-03-09 00:00:00	My comment was not related to freedom of the press, but I was questioning the outrageous title of the film. Perverted minds exist in all societies, but to hint that one whole society has a sick mind not only is ridiculous but does not help resolve a problem.
241	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Very well said! A fact is a fact, nobody can hide it for long.
242	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I agree with you that BBC is prejudiced and there are worse events in UK. I have been living here longer than you and I am yet to see BBC say something positive about India. But yesterdays documentary was a true reflection of the mentality of most (not all) Indian men. Let us take the positive things to learn from this documentary and not dwell on the negative works of BBC. I only wish someone from India would have done the documentary themselves.
243	2015-03-06 00:00:00	So according to this incident is nothing compared to what happens in the UK... But do the lawyers in UK behave and make same statements like the Indian defense lawyer did...
244	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes, Freedom of speech in the west only applies to faith and beliefs of non-christian religion. if anything is said about their religion it will probably be banned, especially around election time.
245	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Please don't bring religion in to this discussion. We are discussing social evil which has nothing to do with religion.
246	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Thanks for saying this, I was going to say about the US...and also look sometimes how these countries treat people who are whistle blowers..............thanks for sharing your comment.
247	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Sorry I fully agree. I pushed the disagree button.
248	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What laws are you talking about.. In India dont lecture me about laws... A VVIP convoy mows down a civilian and does not stop to provide aid to the victim even though there was an ambulance in the convoy what action has been taken.. and by the way the minister was in the middle the van hit the victim first and this idiot did not know of it... even after serious injury to the driver and other cop.. What law applies to them... Fact is Indians and ministers can break the law but if BBC does it is a hue and cry.. The victims parents have seen the video and did not object so why are others... Do they feel more pain than the parents... Fact is the video shows Indian in bad light in both cultural. heritage aspects and women related crimes... This is what the govt does not want others to see.. The comments made by the defense lawyer... about women and this is a lawyer who is educated...
249	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Dont cry about that VVIP incident, more people in india dis in road accidents than anywhere in the world. it is everyone's responsibility yo follow the road safety while crossing and walking on the roads. If you drive on the indian city roads you understand how careless these two wheeler drivers and pedestrians are. they think it is the responsibility of the other person to save their life. if you dont care for yourself, why others should. how long others can take care of you. it was not any VVIP who made that accident, it was also an ordinary man who was driving that vehicle.
250	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Then salman khan is not guilty cuz they were sleeping on the footpath.. When they should have slept in the house... Or is it because he is a muslim that he is being targeted...
251	2015-03-06 00:00:00	you are not supposed to drive on foot path. in this case, the person was crossing the road without looking around for the moving vehicle or at least that is what was reported.
252	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Exactly, defense lawyers comments were appalling. Can you imagine a woman going to them to represent her in rape case? Did the defense lawyers collude with the rapist to make the comments that the rapist make. Surely they would have advised him not to take part and implicate himself. Mr. Sharma said, he would douse his daughter with petrol and set her alight himself in front of whole family if she went out with a boy. An educated man saying this on BBC documentary - Did he not know it will aired world wide and expose his bigotry. By the way both lawyers had appalling English.
253	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I agree with most of what you say. Be worried about the lawyers attitude rather than their English. You would not expect a decent human being to defend these criminals, nor can you expect a decent client to approach them for a representation. The only statement made by the defence lawyers which I agree was that 250 sitting MPs have allegations of rape. Rest of what they said was a sad but true reflection of the mentality of Indian men.
254	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Both the defense lawyers are arch BJP party supporters.
255	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Have you watched this documentary? It is a true reflection of what has happened / is happening in India. Rather than being defensive because truth is always bitter, let us change our attitude towards women. BBC held a mirror to our face, why are you blaming the image you are seeing or the mirror or even the hand that held the mirror? Blame the dirty reflection you are seeing in the mirror and change the (mental) outlook. We did not have the courage to hold the mirror ourselves and it is sad some outsider should show us the reality. I watched this programme yesterday night, there is nothing untruthful about the sad episode. The only shameful fact is that the criminals and the defence lawyers were unrepentant and were justifying their deeds. It is a true reflection of the medieval attitude of Indian men. Who gave permission to BBC? After all they did not film this secretly. Sheila Dikshit was interviewed, then it would mean that someone from the top gave the nod. Why are you now blaming the BBC for doing a favour to us provided we have the courage to look at ourselves in all honesty and rectify our mindset.
256	2015-03-06 00:00:00	well said bro
257	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What permission from courts that allow lawyers to operate who say that there is no place for women in our culture. If you have seen the documentary - the views about women by the two defense lawyers were appalling. I am surprised that womens groups, activists and law abiding citizens have not reported these defense lawyers to Law society of Indian and have them struck of register.
258	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The lawyers opinion is not the opinion of general public like you and me and the Bar council are taking actions against these sick people who are according to me worse than the rapists. Having said that BBC should still respect our courts order. Once everything was cleared they could have aired the Doc. Yes I have watched the Doc and did like it baring few bits but then its my personal opinion. Disregarding our Courts is like showing middle finger to our whole system. It is disrespect to our country and I will not take it any day.
259	2015-03-06 00:00:00	noncen. this happnd during Congress rule. Why should BJP cover up somethng that happnd under the nose of Shinde? r u crazy?
260	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Because it exposes the mindsets of both Congress and BJP politicians who have made same statement as the raspists
261	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The black money also happened then so why should they bother... The Law has to be changed - did they make an attempt to do so.. no... fact is crimes against women are part of hindu culture.. It is in their religious books as well... That is why they will not do anything for the women - It is part of their culture...  Bride Burning, Dowry, Child Marriage. Killing of the girl child.. Bride harassment after marriage is all part of the culture.. You cant run away from the truth...
262	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Wonderful. Perfect response. Just one caution: hope the person killed was definitely the rapist.
263	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Agreed! What if someone has settled a score? In India, anything can happen.
264	2015-03-06 00:00:00	True...that was what I was cautioning about.
265	2015-03-09 00:00:00	that implies justice for no one, only crooks and powerful to survive..better leave the country for good..
266	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes, I agree. What if the victim was lying?? Then how is this justified?
267	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is an issue of people taking law in their own hands because they do not believe in speedy justice or they think the criminal (assuming he is) will go scot free by manipulating the system. This is a message to our justice system. Ofcourse this mob system fails if the acussed is not guilty. One more thing - if this act atleast instills some fear in the minds of rapists in future, then atleast some good came out of it.
268	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If he was not, let him rest in peace...we cannot do anything to bring him to life..let this be set as an example of what can happen if the people loose their cool..
269	2015-03-06 00:00:00	My worry is that knowing how things happen in India, it is possible that the culprits if not the guy who got lynched, could have used this opportunity to kill an innocent or a newbie accomplice in order to protect themselves. This is worrying me. A full independent investigation hopefully get completed in this to assure that the right culprit was killed.  I agree that people in general is sick and tired of the incompetent police response to r@pe.
270	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Lets salute to the people of Nagaland
271	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The problem is deeper then the solution, the question is why? people when subjected to different environments will behave differently and they cannot rationale like a civilized person. If the perpetrator grows up in an environment that encourages these acts, will punishing him solves the problem. If he was born in a educated family, morale values, civilized society, will he commit the crime or will he be a different person? Blaming just him maybe not the answer and the punishment he got should have been to the system and not him. If a child behaves badly than its the parents and teachers to blame not the child. Indian society is suppressed and these crimes are bound to happen. No proper order in society and plenty of opportunistic people. Someone deprived of food will steal, same thing here. The price he paid or the suffering of the victim is entirely tied to the society which needs to be educated, need to be made civilized. Many of the people commenting here probably would not hesitate urinating of road side, should we blame them or the society that could not provide a toilet?
272	2015-03-06 00:00:00	educated people also commit crimes, it has nothing to do with economics YOU FOOLISH DOG. EVEN THE MUSLIMS COMMITING CRIME IN MIDDLE EAST CAME FROM EDUCATED FAMILIES IN EUROPE, GO GET YOUR HEAD CHECKED YOU DOG
273	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Your language tells a lot about you and your upbringing from what I wrote in my message. Go and check the facts, lot of middle east have low crime rates due to severe punishments from the government.
274	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The problem in this case is that Nagaland and the rest of the NE s flooded by illegal Bangladeshis. High time the people kicked them out.
275	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I agree ! all of us need to salute
276	2015-03-06 00:00:00	In north east i heard rape is a very rare occurence. They have lot of respect for women and women often go out at night without fear
277	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Very Very true. We have both matrilineal and matriachal system in Meghalaya. They have equal status in not higher..
278	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Do the same to the juvenile in the Nirbhaya case.
279	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Yes, that is very essential, though he is juvenile, he was very cruel. I learnt he inserted metal rod and caused damage to her internal organs. The justice system in our country make him a hard core criminal if let free by the people. His birth certificate produced were also susceptible, because one judge from his community had special interest in his case.
280	2015-03-06 00:00:00	His identity s well protectd . bcs he belongs to a peace loving minorty community
281	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I think his identity is protected because he is under 18.
282	2015-03-06 00:00:00	his identity is protected  otherwise he will be lynched to death by Mob after he comes out of the juvenile home
283	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Though a wrong action but People will be compelled to take law in their hands because our Justice System is incomplete and ineffective.
284	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Thanks to the support from the current govt...
285	2015-03-05 00:00:00	This lynching by mob is a reply to Mukesh, the rapist who said rapists in future will kill their victims if he and his men were hanged.  People of this country have lost confidence in the judiciary or speedy dispensation of justice.
286	2015-03-06 00:00:00	RUBBISH! THE GOOD BBC FILM WILL HELP OUR INDIA &amp; INDIANS BECOME BETTER. IT WILL HELP US EMANCIPATE OURSELVES FROM OUR MEGA TERRORIST, ULTRA ANARCHIST, SUPER CORRUPT, CRIMINAL, USELESS, ANTI-INDIA, ANTI-HUMAN, ANTI-INDIAN, ANTI-HINDU, ANTI-MUSLIM, ANTI-SIKH, ANTI-CHRISTIAN, ANTI-JAIN, ANTI-BUDDHIST, ANTI-JEW, ANTI-PARSI, ANTI-ATHEIST, ANTI-AGNOSTIC, 6TH RATE, BELOW CATTLE &amp; GUTTER CLASS, 0-BRAIN, RETARDED &amp; CP-STRICKEN JOKEPAL BJP, CON &amp; THEIR EQUALLY USELESS ALLIES THAT RULED INDIA 1947-2015 &amp; CREATED ALL THESE PROBLEMS TO OPPRESS &amp; EXPLOIT US 24-7.
287	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Srikumar ,  Arent you the same AAP looser who was advocating the Muffler Bluffer?
288	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Arvind Khansiwal proved one thing - Humans cannot handle power..the moment he rose to power, he became one man power..
289	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Chill out man, your repeated ranting has lost its value. Focus on the topic rather than cutting and pasting your views on the stale lokpal in UPPER CASE. If you have nothing constructive to say then your silence would be more honourable rather than repeating the irrelevant spam.
290	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Have you gone mad? All countries have worse or similar rules, do you want to go to Pakistan or some Muslim nation to become happy and rich. See they are getting free money from oil and keep harem of girls at different places in the world, may be they will share that luxury with you.
291	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Nagaland in general doesn't have any cases of rape committed by the natives.  Naga man in general donot go around raping girls because our cultural and social set up is different.  Most of the Rapes cases that occur there are committed by Illegal Bangladeshi Immigrants. The people did the right thing.  This will teach everyone to think twice before committing such crimes again.  And another important thing is,  the district magistrate almost granted bail to the rapist and hence the people got frustrated and dragged him out of prison to deliver justice.  The girl he raped hanged herself after she complained to the police.  He definitely deserved death.  He raped a local Naga-Indian girl 3 times and then expected a swift bail.  People did the right thing.  India's judicial system sucks.
292	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good comment from grass root level in Nagaland
293	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The guilty got punished. Justice served.
294	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Advocates who cook up stories, character assassinate rape victims in order to extract fat fee from accused must meet similar end. We have been cheated enough in name of right to justice, fairness in trial.
295	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Infact the whole judicial system must meet the similar end. Either they shall do the job in right manner and within right time or quit it. We don't need snails in our judicial system.
296	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Wow ,, i am very very happy- keep it up
297	2015-03-06 00:00:00	awesome people , pls come to delhi also for the rapist of nirbhaya
298	2015-03-06 00:00:00	oh they are on their way.... but delhi police will probably make a bloody scene if they try to break into the jail to get the convict. will be a sad and gruesome ending to their march.
299	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Mob thrashes au violeur présumé mort au Nagaland
300	2015-03-05 00:00:00	See how militant Christians of Nagaland behave and kill a Bangladeshi Muslim molester.  and People used to blame RSS and call them militant Hindus.
301	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Please dont drag RSS into everything and try to malign them
302	2015-03-05 00:00:00	ideally..i like those chritians then chut!yaa bhaiyyas..
303	2015-03-05 00:00:00	BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEGA RAPISTS &amp; SUPER CRIMINALS BEHIND THIS CRIMINAL? HOW ABOUT THE ULTRA THUGS WHO MAKE IT PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE FOR THESE CRIMES TO BE PERPETRATED? WHEN WILL THE GOOD BBC EXPOSE THEM &amp; THEREBY SAVE OUR INDIA &amp; INDIANS FROM THEIR OPPRESSION 24-7 1947-2015?
304	2015-03-05 00:00:00	A rapist or a terrorist have no religion... Do you question the religion of the victims before the act.. Moron... Unless it is what the Hindus do if that is what you are implying...
305	2015-03-05 00:00:00	It will be interesting to see if the same happens to someone near or dear to you and you still hold the same opinion
306	2015-03-05 00:00:00	unfortunately the rapist is BJP follower and member.
307	2015-03-06 00:00:00	he was bangladshi muzzi
308	2015-03-06 00:00:00	since when did Muslims start joining RSS?
309	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is case of rape, why ru trying to give religion color, people like u r slaves of RSS.
310	2015-03-05 00:00:00	You are blind. He was a rapist not a molester. With the way justice is delivered in India, this is not entirely unjustified. See Nirbhaya case or High profile Arun Tejpal case
311	2015-03-06 00:00:00	WHOA !! What is this militant christian you are talking about ?? Is there a militant hindu or a militant muslim or militant anything ??? Of what caste is this rapist mukesh-He is a confirmed or admitedly confessed rapist. Isnt he a hindu ? Do you imply that just because the judges are hindus they have soft corner for a hindu rapist ?The NE tribals and not only Nagas guard their wives and daughters zealously. They are not a soft race.Religion or caste or race doesnt come into reckoning when heinous crimes are committed..
312	2015-03-06 00:00:00	DON'T PROVOKE CHRISTIANS LET THAT BE A WARNING, PATIENCE WILL RUN TO AN EXTENT, THEN IT WILL ERUPT INTO BLOOD BATH. CHRISTIANS ARE NOT ANGELS THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS.
313	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People like you will bring politics in everything and pass judgement without having the slightest idea of the ground reality, typical trait of politically brainwashed morons who dilute the gravity of any situation with your slanders.
314	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Mr. Sanjay guys like you are dividing our society into parts and pieces and this is the prime reason of our forces being directionless. We want to fight together but as soon as guys like you see United Indians came up with political statements hurting feelings of one or the other part of society leading to restive actions. Its really a curse to have guys like you in our society. If some actions are being taken as in this case you should understand that we (Indians) are now out of patience. We have shown enough patience and now if our law is spineless then we have to take it in our hands and show these criminals their exact place in the society.
315	2015-03-06 00:00:00	CONGRESS HAS ALREADY DIVIDED, DO NOT BLAME  PEOPLE HERE, PLEASE
316	2015-03-06 00:00:00	RSS and BJP are going in full force to divide further and faster than ever before. Just see the news unfolding everyday.
317	2015-03-05 00:00:00	This is the result of judicial incompetence and failure... people are sick and tired of injustice that is being forced by  our judiciary... congrats people of Nagaland.. good job and a terrific deterrence. Now may be another rape may happen in nagaland after 100years.
318	2015-03-05 00:00:00	All rapist should be handed over to Public in Nagaland. Good job
319	2015-03-06 00:00:00	yea suggest to govt lol.
320	2015-03-05 00:00:00	bEST PUNISHMENT FOR A RAPIST.
321	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Good way the people of Nagaland has shown as that is the only way to get justice in India as depending on courts and judges mean life long experience and ordeal as only lawyers will be benefitted and all the courts contain most corrupt judges and hence people have to take the law in their hands and then only the judiciary will shiver.
322	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Finally a rape victim got justice in INDIA. People of Kohima saved a lot of time and mental harassment this victim would have suffered in courts and police stations. A big salute to these people.
323	2015-03-05 00:00:00	well done.. got as deserved.. we need to learn from them in how to serve justice
324	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Street justice..people could breach a district jail?? now thats awesome.
325	2015-03-06 00:00:00	There is no other option left other than to take law in their own hands for the citizens of this nation. So many rapists are roaming freely. The one's who get convicted sit in jail forever... There is no sign of justice. So a well served justice by the mob. And this is just the beginning. There will be more to come if the authorities do not get serious about the safety of women in this country. Well done the people of Nagaland!
326	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Every person in the Mob deserves a Padma Bhushan! Something 535 idiots could not do in the Parliament, people have done it!!
327	2015-03-06 00:00:00	i support this act fir every rapist.... let everyone advocate this in india... rapists will fear masses coz law is nonsense in India
328	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I would support if Crowd dispensed Justice that way.
329	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Though barbaric, this perhaps, was the muted anger of the society, which had a burst because of the long delays in the courts and police investigations. Let the courts and the govt take notice of the simmering angre of Aam Admi on the long delays in the system to provide justice. For Delhi gang rape case in 2012, the fast track court was established and today even after 2 and half years the rapists still have not been hanged.
330	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Unfortunate. But this will happen to any criminal accused. Where courts moves so slow, a judgement comes after long long time, victims suffers but criminals enjoy, people would loss respect and fear of laws.People will take law on order on their own hand. and in that, also many innocent person will be killed by blaming tricks.
331	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well, Indian judicial system won't punish them so someone has to do the job.
332	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Great. This is the way. I am proud of these guys. Let us do the same with Nirbhayas rapist and the Nepali girls 9 rapist in Haryana. Please, Let us do the same with them also because POLICE and LAW in this country are IMPOTENT.
333	2015-03-05 00:00:00	This will set a bad precedent but the Rapist met the justified end
334	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If he is a real rapist without provocation, than is is a very good precedent.  The law and police have been too soft on the criminals.
335	2015-03-05 00:00:00	This is a shame on our judiciary, that people are fed up waiting forever for justice.  We should start demanding accountability from our judges.  They are paid servants like everyone else, and if they are getting paid, they should start putting in the hours. The constitution has been poorly written if our justices are allowed to work without any accountability.
336	2015-03-05 00:00:00	iron rod bhi ghusana tha naa ..
337	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sources said around 20 protesters were injured in the clashes.
338	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Now no more hope from LAWS. Justice on the roads will be in future in present circumstances.
339	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Congratulations to people of Nagaland, for setting a good example of justice.
340	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well done! People of Nagaland. You did what our courts, governments and law enforcement agencies couldn't do. Salutes to the people of Nagaland.
341	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Fuccking Great......Let do it all over India
342	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am against violence in general. But in this case, mob has given instant justice on the eve of women's day which is lot better than BBC airing rapist Mukesh view on women's eve for sensationalism and painting entire India as rapists.
343	2015-03-06 00:00:00	all the potential rapists in the forum are worried here and defending rapist and condemning the mob. Abbey if you did nothing wrong, then why are you so scared of the mob?
344	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Come on !! If you see 10 people running towards you , who wouldn't be scared?
345	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Do you have to be a rapist to be scared of a mob?? Man, your kind of thinking shows what kind of "intellectual geniuses" we have in the country. Tomorrow if someone falsely accuses you of some crime , and you see 100 people  baying for your blood , then will you not be running like a hare??
346	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When there is no hope from Police, government, law &amp; order these sort of incidents keep happening to safeguard them and their families.
347	2015-03-06 00:00:00	so happy to read a news like this... few more incidents like these for all rapist.. :) :D
348	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The legal system needs to be more stern and fast-paced.. People are growing restless and losing faith in judicial system. No wonder they are taking the law into their own hands.
349	2015-03-06 00:00:00	GREAT, THIS IS INDIA. WAY TO GO INDIA, FINALLY PEOPLE POWER DID SOMETHING COURTS CAN NOT DO, SONIA OR NAMO CAN NOT DO. GO TO ALL JAILS OR STREETS WHERE THEY ARE HIDING AND GET RID OF THEM, AND WATCH THE VERY THIRD MONTH AFTER AND WILL STAY THERE FOR A LONG TIME,  THIS RAPE RATE WILL PLUNGE TO ZERO, NO FURTHER LAWS OR POLICE WILL BE NEEDED.
350	2015-03-06 00:00:00	december 2015, nirbhaya's juvenile rapist is going to be released. Either a mob should deliver justice to him the same way or hire some other juvenile to deliver justice .. (read deliver justice as killing him)
351	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Loved it well done nagaland, shame on delhi !!!!  people should enter tihar and drag the rapist out and kill him infront of india gate
352	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Delhi itself is a rapist's territory. Nothing doing.
353	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is a good lesson for all rapists.
354	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Congrats to all 4000 brave hearts
355	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Why cant the media speak the truth??? Just because the rapist is a bangladeshi immigrant this sick media all of sudden becomes so neutral. Just because the rapist is from minority community the media is so protective of his identity? While the same media is speaking against the govt banning a bbc documentry that gives out the real name and identity of Nirbhaya. Why these double standards even for a rape.
356	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Hats off!! the best solution especially to "THE RAPE" o any kinda CRIME in country like India where law is nothing more than a piece of sh*t to mock upon, where a  terrorist is fed for years and a rapist is not less than a guest to be fed upon for years and then just left in open air..
357	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Quick justice. They did not want to waste a decade and public money to see justice.
358	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Law makers and judges are blind and corrupt, police cannot be trusted.
359	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This should happen to all rapist
360	2015-03-06 00:00:00	we should all unite and act the same way so taht no one can dare to do such crimes
361	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This was to happen... Jail term is not sufficient.. Juvenile is bullsshit...
362	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well done people of Nagaland.. This is how rapists are to be treated. Million like..
363	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is the answer to all the pending cases in courts.......change the system or people will take the charge
364	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am not surprised. This is what happens when common man run out of patience. Although i don't support the act but this should be a lesson for the govt and judiciary that if the justice is delayed, there are other ways to get justice.
365	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Justice served. Case closed.
366	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Fastest Track Court .
367	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Justice delivered in minutes... good work
368	2015-03-06 00:00:00	How's this a bad thing? Justice is served..  Period
369	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Very good. Keep it up. Justice delivered. Same should be done to all rapists throughout the world. Well done.
370	2015-03-05 00:00:00	I really hope the person was indeed the rapist!! Rest all is fair in this god forsaken judicial system.
371	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Well done.  Many more such retaliations will set the record straight.
372	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Exactly! This is how rapists must be dealt with to deter them from perpetrating such crimes.
373	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is all outburst of Public against the Govt attitude against such cases and Long delay in judicial enquiries....
374	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Without any comments on legal and ethical intricacies,it was an instant wild justice.What could be a better punishment of a rapist ?It will strike terror in hearts of mischief-makers.
375	2015-03-07 00:00:00	WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS NOTING ELSE BUT JUSTICE AS PER ISLAMIC SHARIAH LAW.
376	2015-03-06 00:00:00	#When criminal justice system fails, mob justice prevails.
377	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is how revolution takes place When law becomes lawless people are bound to react and get down to streets
378	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The nagas have really done a good job. But why did they burnt shops of non nagas?  Actually these people like to harass non nagas who are settled there. This great job they had only done because the girl was a naga. They would not have done the same if the victim was a non naga. As i grew from this  part of India i have seen how the nagas are ill treat non nagas.
379	2015-03-06 00:00:00	that the public had to resort to such act shows the frustration and lack of faith in the judicial justice in India ... it is this system that needs to be remedied ...
380	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Great job carry on common people of india teach rapist and criminal a good lesson and don't forget the corrupt one also
381	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well done.
382	2015-03-06 00:00:00	That's what we need, swift and gruesome punishment to any rapist... as they did to Gaddafi!!
383	2015-03-06 00:00:00	All rapists deserve it. Try this method and rapes will reduce dramatically.
384	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Excellent example set by the people. We are proud of people of Nagaland.
385	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is the most popular and best solution for rape in India.
386	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When people lose faith in Police and judiciary, they will become the jury, judge and executioner. Beware!
387	2015-03-06 00:00:00	.....   some people from Dimapur have to be called to Delhi to straighten out many things.........
388	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The Cabinet should in fact WAKE UP and demand why the SC is delaying the Nirbhaya case. This incident in Dimapur may be related to loss of faith in our judicial system where it takes a few decades for justice on an open &amp; shut case too.
389	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Best justice for rapists
390	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Though inhuman act is never appreciable yet punishment for inhuman act should be inhuman so that others don't dare.
391	2015-03-06 00:00:00	the gang rapists of dec.16, are under trial for more than two years. this is happening in the fast track court. what will hapen if this case is tried in normal court ???  the result of these trials in courts is frustrating for victims and the families.some of these victims are subjected to mental torture in the courts by asking unethical or embarassing questions in full public view. Hence general public has lost the faith in these indian courts. so they resort to take the law in their hands and settle the score with the culprits.
392	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If government does not give justice to the victims in fast track courts then this is only the tip of the iceberg. The nation is boiling in anger god knows what form it takes.
393	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Perfect. All rapists, child molesters and perverts MUST be paraded around naked and beaten to death.  P.S. The mob need'nt have burned the cars on the way to jail. Why trouble innocent people? Youngsters in Delhi and Haryana.... protect your womenfolk, don't stand around making a video, instill fear in the hearts of these predators.   Learn from these guys in nagaland!! Police and goverment has proven to be impotent.  Human rights guys..... chill.... predators lose the human tag the moment predatory instincts take over.
394	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Without a doubt it will happen and that will put the fear of GOD into the Rapists
395	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Without a doubt it will happen and that will put the fear of GOD into the Rapists
396	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Without a doubt it will happen and that will put the fear of GOD into the Rapists
397	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what happens when people have lost belief in justice
398	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Without a doubt it will happen and that will put the fear of GOD into the Rapists
399	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Guess this will happen when justice is delayed
400	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is the correct way to give justice to victim.... salute to naga ppl...
401	2015-03-06 00:00:00	,,,, ,,, at least this will be an example to other moreover it also indicated that waiting for justice is not the only option
402	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It was because of people's anger against growing population of Illegal Bangladeshi Immigrants in Nagaland. Had the alleged rapist been a Naga or a mon-Naga of Indian origin, public would not have reacted in this manner. Let us flush out Bangladeshis by not givjng them employment, house on rent etc.
403	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If he is the convict then very good Nagaland people. Proud of you people.
404	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The same act can be done in the Delhi Jail as well because the justice is too much delayed in the case of Nirbhaya rapists. Can the police arrests 10,000 people and put them behind bars?
405	2015-03-06 00:00:00	our souls are dead. We have become insensitive. We shed tears for death of a rapist illegal immigrant but do not worry about rape of a young girl. MHA never seeks report from State when a girl gets raped but it seeks report from State when mob kills a rapist.
406	2015-03-06 00:00:00	if he was indeed a rapist, then well deserved.. I don't have any sympathy whatsoever..
407	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This was indeed waiting to happen.How long do we have to tolerate this incompetent judicial system?
408	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Excellent job done! The rest of the nation needs to learn from this and give similar treatment to rapists caught red handed or definitely guilty (those who accept guilt). Our courts take too long and the laws have too many loopholes and escape avenues, eg the fact that a man 17 years and 11 months can get a maximum jail sentence of just three years!
409	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Unless our justice delivery system becomes sincere and effective, this is what will increasingly happen. People taking the law into their hands is undesirable, but they can't be blamed for meting out justice on their own. There is no justice in Indian courts.
410	2015-03-06 00:00:00	India...wake up and salute these guys!!! instead of wearing bangles...
411	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Temporarily it sounds brave and punishing the rapist. But it is not a good thing that people go beyond the control of the administration. Such public prosecution is a bad signal for democracy.
412	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Excellent!
413	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the rape was true then well done!!!! This is what should happen all over India
414	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is bound to happen  and should  happen everywhere when the entire machinary is full of corruption and the judicial system  moves at a snail's pace.
415	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Nagaland people have shown how NIRBHAYA act to be amended.Well done---Bkjayanti
416	2015-03-06 00:00:00	India Justice System Does not deliver Justice, it gives court dates.
417	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Now we just need to repeat this for all the crAAPtards
418	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The civilised society may have their rullings for crimanal offences, but the Naga society has laid a fine example of what puishment a rapist should be given.Some one had said "rAPE IS AN UNKNOWN CRIME IN NAGA SOCIETY." A very fine way of dealing in cases of crime and punishment. Let us learn from them for quiest way of dealing in such cases.
419	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is lynching. This is murder. You cannot take law into your hands in the name of justice and destroy the justice itself. This does not happen in the civilized world. I know, some of us will laud this action. But it does not augur well for the nation. It will lead to anarchy.
420	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the law is good enough, this wouldn't have happened in first place. People are losing patience. They are fed up with the judicial processes which eventually let the rapists roam free.
421	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Is lynching a solution? The mob reaction need not be sane.
422	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It's not. It's not what civilized people should do. Rather they should have just put him to shame instead of killing to instill fear in rapists minds.
423	2015-03-06 00:00:00	it is what civilized people should do to rapists, only rapists defend rapists
424	2015-03-06 00:00:00	same with you, if you rape a woman you will be dragged out and burnt alive. So don't do it if you don't want to be killed. Defending rapists is a rapist himself
425	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am not defending the rapists. It is our  judicial system that prosecutes them and also provides them with defense lawyers. That is the way it is. Individuals like me have no say in the matter.
426	2015-03-06 00:00:00	get lost .
427	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Dumbass, we are not defending rapists. Understand first before commenting..
428	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Gosh! This news made me feel so good. This is what happens when we have a judiciary system that has never worked nor its ever going to work in the future. So  this is the best way to deal with the situation. Haven't we waited long enough for justice for that poor girl? Where every single day  somebody or the other comes up with new joke.
429	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When Justice fails this is inevitable and in a way it should be an example for all the rapist.
430	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Kudos to our Naga brothers! They have shown the way! Enough of this nonsense of our useless justices in SC - old men talking garbage....
431	2015-03-06 00:00:00	love the nagaland's ppl for this...every true citizen of india is with them
432	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is what needs to be done to the :JUVENILE ACCUSED" in Nirbhaya's case..
433	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is what should happen with Nirbhaya's rapists.
434	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I love people of Nagaland for this... This is the exact punishment for the rapists!
435	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What the alleged Rapists who are in  M0D!'s cabinet and others who are Parliamentarians???
436	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Is it India?! That's the spirit of unity.. though killing is not at all right.
437	2015-03-06 00:00:00	God bless the brave citizens justice delivered aptly and timely.... wish we could do this to all criminals in India than wait for archiac british system of judiciary
438	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is the country where the most powerful Britishers had to quit, even after having support from few powerful royal family of the country. So now I feel that the people are fed up of the system and may be now criminals will have a difficult time.
439	2015-03-06 00:00:00	very happy
440	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Job well done
441	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good treatment........ Fantastic judgement.!!!!!
442	2015-03-06 00:00:00	people power.. which u don't mess with
443	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Nice and swift justice,,,, Beat that!!!
444	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well done people. Judiciary would not have punished this guilty. Bring Sharia law to stop the menace of rape  from India
445	2015-03-06 00:00:00	the indian judges go : wow!  that was fast. we take 20 years to decide such cases.
446	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This , a result of frustration  shows how ineffective the law and administration is in handling serious offences.....UNlike civilised coubntries where the judicial process is quick and delivers hard enough punishment to restrain the rest , in indoia law and judicary is sure route to escape due to its delay and various clauses .....the ministry is not worried about the various incidents of rapes but the crowds reaction.!!!!   alas...the value system is being re written.......we still want cinemas, page 3 , advts and such other western style  to instigate our youth who get caught in the temptation web  and are falling into the trap.....think deep...solve at the root and not the hat only....
447	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good to hear. this should happen every where.
448	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Well done. If law takes 2 years without justice we have  right to take justice in own hands
449	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Great work by the people. This is the only justice for rapists
450	2015-03-06 00:00:00	That's exactly people should.  dont go to police station and court only to wait and finally get insulted.  just kill the rapist.
451	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Actually it gives a good message
452	2015-03-06 00:00:00	He had it coming...
453	2015-03-06 00:00:00	"Never Underestimate the power of Common People", A very big Message to the Law maker, "Courage is contagious" it spread faster the The Deadly flu, People are Fed Up of waiting for justice, Justice have to be done immediately to prevent further crimes. A wake up call to the Law maker, don't take it easy, thanks to the Brave Nagaland people for the Right set example. even though taking Law in their own hand is not appropriate.
454	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the judiciary were doing its job then people did not have to do this. Well deserved end to the rapist.
455	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good job
456	2015-03-06 00:00:00	YES!!!!
457	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good this the real justice done
458	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I can understand that people were emotionally charged but this shouldn't have happened  1. The rapist was yet to be proved and convicted 2. The article says "students and angry people forced into the district jail and managed to pull out the accused" - This is a serious security issue. Is it really so easy for people to barge into the jails and drag the prisoners out. Also the people have put the security of many others at risk because some serious criminals could have escaped 3. Police fired blanks and tear gas but it didn't work - Again proves that our system of effective governance and control is not upto the mark  We are a civilized country. If people start taking law into their own hands then we will soon become an anarchy like Syria, Libya etc.  My prayers and thoughts with the rape victim and her family.
459	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is precisely the issue - that rapist never get convicted after a prolonged court case. most witnesses are dead or fed up or bought over ... so what you are preaching is idealistic and for that you need effective court system. Remember justice delayed is justice denied.
460	2015-03-06 00:00:00	You summed it up nicely. But if your gf/wife/sister/mother  got raped and she hung herself and the convict was being let out on bail. I wonder how much of reason will you be able to hold onto.
461	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Congrats to Nagaland people.This is the only solution to curb the rapes.And why their  govt.condemned the violent incident.What the state and central govt. done in Nirbhaya rape case upto now.The rapists are relaxing in jail and giving cheap interviews to the foreigners alongwith their advocates.Had they been hanged by now India's image would not have been tarnished.Still the govt and judiciary.couldn't muster courage to hang them.Nagaland people must be appreciated by all.The five rapists of Nirbhaya must be hanged immediately.And their advocates must be stripped,face be painted black and left to the street dogs.Then see how many rape cases take place,I bet none.
462	2015-03-05 00:00:00	What has modi to do with this incident idiot
463	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Good that's the only way to get justice in this country!
464	2015-03-05 00:00:00	if he was rapist, then why complain, let him die...
465	2015-03-05 00:00:00	MODI should stop dramas now and act as people are fed up of BJP and taking law into their hands.
466	2015-03-06 00:00:00	What is kejri doing, you aaptard ?
467	2015-03-06 00:00:00	LOL....pls buy some sense and then talk
468	2015-03-06 00:00:00	do you know where it is sold?
469	2015-03-06 00:00:00	lol...how I was expecting this question from you...will give u the address soon..
470	2015-03-05 00:00:00	usually our judiciary take time to convict the accused  so the victim n thier family become for the justice.
471	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Wow...but what i heard about the report in some other site goes on to say that the girl somehow was playing along with they guy- forgive me if i heard it wrong-  only to come back and accuse him of rape something like that? This lynching should have happened rather with the Nirbhaya rapsists.
472	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Huh? You heard .. where? news report do not collaborate your version. Agreed gang rapist and especially ones that kill their victim should get handed capital punishment swiftly....
473	2015-03-05 00:00:00	The police and judicial system must be honest. Justice should not  be delayed.
474	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Good work !!!   we should same with all rapist...!!!! they dnt deserve luxury of living !!!
475	2015-03-05 00:00:00	This should have been done with Delhi rapists.
476	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Well done Nagaland..  This is the only way of preventing CRIME against WOMEN
477	2015-03-05 00:00:00	people lost faith in Modi and his corrupt and communal govt and this is the result.
478	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Good.. Justice served... Needs to replicated pan India...
479	2015-03-05 00:00:00	very Good that is what should be happening to stupid sick rapists!! beaten to death..
480	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Perfect!!!!!!
481	2015-03-05 00:00:00	he is only accused not convicted...poor soul if he is not the right one..
482	2015-03-06 00:00:00	And if he is the right one? Justice served.
483	2015-03-06 00:00:00	the problem is, he may remain just 'accused' for just about too long even if he is the rapist.
484	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Delay justice makes this crime so frequent.
485	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This should happen for every heinous crime!
486	2015-03-08 00:00:00	When the law does not deliver justice, people will deliver justice....LOL!!!!
487	2015-03-08 00:00:00	RIGHT PUNISHMENT - DEAR GOI - LOOK AT DISPOSING RAPE / MURDER &amp; SCAM CASES IN 20 DAYS.'JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED'.IN  THIS CASE JUSTICE HAS BEEN DELIVERED.'EXCELLENT'.
488	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because the rapist is a cruel Muslim....................all secular anti-India people are out to protect a criminal.......................
489	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If he is the culprit, he got the right Punishment endorsed by Islamic Law(Death to the Rapist), but against the Indian Law...
490	2015-03-08 00:00:00	YES, WHEN PEOPLE LOOSE FAITH IN THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM THEY TAKE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. IT IS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR THE JUDICIARY. AND TO THE GOVT TO DO SOMETHING OTHERWISE IT WILL BE ANARCHY-WHICH BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL....
491	2015-03-08 00:00:00	its seems that people does nor have beleive in our judiciary system .
492	2015-03-08 00:00:00	*A REQUIEM FOR NIRBHAYA "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!
493	2015-03-08 00:00:00	*  WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her poor ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished ans much yearned dream Yet you made sure she never bagged even that humble dream! Going to a movie with a kith when the night was still tender Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so good and tender Her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat Instead of bedecking her bridal chamber with blooms most fragrant and bright, sod! And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry loud and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-smeared parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream, sod! Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that agony-torn mummy Will scorch the earth? And you never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so sub-human to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains embedded in the intellect; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Heven is only a place on earth; you know not? Why you didn't  really know that even I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not Mind! But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you hear it or take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Unscrupulous hypocrite and stealer of all human happiness, was it too much to ask for?
494	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There now does that feel better?????? What is the difference between these idiots and the guy who is ALLEGED to have raped??? These idiots are truly guilty!!! But then again Indians seem to have v little regard for the sanctity of human life don!t they!
495	2015-03-08 00:00:00	As Justice to the victims is a distant dream, Supreme Court of India should hang its head in shame for not putting a justice system in place. Same applies to President and the Parliament headed by PM !

505	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The same should be done to other rapists who are in jail or out on bail. This way there will be few rape cases and women will be safe.
506	2015-03-07 00:00:00	"A mob of around 4,000 people stormed the central jail after breaking two gates and took the accused out of the jail and paraded him naked to the city tower in the heart of Dimapur town
507	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Oh my God, where is the Law??
508	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Will the administration across India now wake up to such reality and stop India from becoming a banana republic?
509	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Crimes including r_pe happen due to bad law and order. And the mob has injured the law and order here. This will aggravate the problem instead of solving the problem this mob wanted to solve (the problem of crimes like r_pe.) .
510	2015-03-07 00:00:00	He was: illegal bangladeshi intruder? That means: he was neither Indian citizen, nor a visa holder. That means: no where Indian establishment took his responsibility. That means: If he is killed here, he is not entitled to judicial help. The mob may be morally wrong, but technically the mob is not the criminal here.
511	2015-03-07 00:00:00	A very good development ! The inherent male chauvinism that the religion of Islam breeds for its brazen followers needs such retribution to prevent such misadventures in future. Infact, if we have a few well publicized public lynchings for rapists, it will be a deterrence for future rapists. Let us start with the rapists of Nirbhaya first.
512	2015-03-07 00:00:00	A perfect instance of mob justice! Actually most criminals are worried about mob justice than the Indian justice system. That says a lot about the country.
513	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Under the situation of very slow delivery of court justice, when mob thinks that lynching is the alternative, can they be blamed?
514	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NO

516	2015-03-07 00:00:00	if govt does not act seriously, there wil be soon more riots to follow.. and it'll be very dangerous for the region..
517	2015-03-07 00:00:00	that was bound to happen.. this is not the anger against the growing number of rapes, but more towards the growing num of illegal bangladeshis in this region.. and people's frustration over that.. the illegal bangladeshis changing the overall demography of the region, in many areas, they are bcoming majority and killing the native people..
518	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Finally a statement has been made.... now the other rapists will be scared after hearing this &amp; it is done once - it can &amp; will be done again.
519	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I love this punishment given by the common people! That is the real power of a common man!
520	2015-03-07 00:00:00	People started taking law in hand because they are frustrated and loosing faith in law. rapes case have been pending for ages and this is a dangerous trend and nobody showing the urgency...
521	2015-03-07 00:00:00	When the fast-track courts cannot deliver justice even after more than two years of the crime in a case that drew international attention, people might take things in their own hands to deliver instant justice as it happens in kangaroo courts.

525	2015-03-07 00:00:00	when u loose cool
526	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Unfortunately, the judiciary is a very slow process in India. People lose faith when the justice is delayed.  Even when the crime is known to everybody, court wants evidence. The court proceedings drag on for years. Even after judgement, the punishment gets delayed due to procedure wrangles and loopholes in the laws. The criminals take advantage of the loopholes and get away.
527	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nothing wrong in documentary.. Only wrong is mindset of the rapists, lawyers.. But even they say something true... That there are 250 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO HAVE CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST THEM... Why are they not punished??? Why only these rapists... Indians have to pass judgement.. Is this the true reason that the GOVT IS BANNING THE FILM???
528	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Lack of faith in judicial system along with mob fury must have resulted in this action.
529	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Holders of Black Money may take a lesson as people are loosing faith in Police Administration for criminal politicians.
530	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The police and the justice department are not fit to protect the innocent people and the criminals are getting away with murder. The same should be done to every rapist good job by the people justice served.

534	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The illegal Bangladeshi in Nagaland, Fareed Khan brutally raped a Naga girl. Thisis the best justice happened since Independence in India.  Rapists donot require our justice system and they should be immediately killed in this manner.
535	2015-03-06 00:00:00	i want to see the looks on their faces if it comes out that that man was innocent. i'm not condemning their outrage, but their methods in expressing it. people band together to protest against such heinous acts but not to prevent them. they do not act when needed but after that. so when i see these protest, it irks me a little. we lack empathy and have that 'not-my-problem' attitude when someone needs aid. we do not learn from our mistakes and thus keep repeating them. unless we, the people, change and take charge, this cycle will go on and on.
536	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This will what happen in India , if police can hand over the rape accused to People instead of the Judiciary. India is full of idle and opportunistic people called human right activist, who are ready to make documentary out of rape accused and make money. So, under the judicial system , rape victims are harassed and rape accused are treated as masked VIPs. This'll be  an eye opener for the entire nation. I am proud of people of Nagaland. Can it happen in UP where rape accused have the backing of so called NETAJI.
537	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the ADMINISTRATION fails to provide justice and security the people will take the law into their hands to justify issues
538	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The mob can not be blamed for giving instant punishment.

540	2015-03-06 00:00:00	there is no law in the country.
541	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Kudos to the people of Nagaland, they really did what was urgently required in this lame jurisdiction system. I am delighted.
542	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Such incidents are the outcome of ineffective law and order and lethargic justice delivery system in our country. The ineffective, purposeless  three out of four pillars of democracy -  Legislature, Executive and Judiciary are responsible for public’s lack of confidence in system.
543	2015-03-06 00:00:00	ON EXPECTED LINES - AS COURTS DRAG AND DELAY THE RAPE CASES, PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REJECTING TO CONSIDER MINOR RAPISTS AS ADULTS. GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACT FAST TO FORM SPECIAL COURTS FOR RAPE CASES AND PUNISH THE RAPISTS TO AVOID MORE SUCH INCIDENTS
544	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It seems the public is now determined to have the death penalty executed for rspe, on way or the other.
545	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is how country breaks up also when mobs take over.
546	2015-03-07 00:00:00	True. All such incidents happen when the people who are expected to act do not do so and deliberately ignore. Hoping to see that day when all rapists belonging to any class, creed, color, region, economically  strong, well connected and powerful, are punished accordingly and quickly. As of today we do not see any fear among the criminals.
547	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Indias mob mentallity increases. Expect more riots for one reason or another.
548	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Nice act/response. This is what all the Indians should be doing to the rapists. There is no hope from the judicial system and rapist fearlessly roam around. This should have been done with Nirbhaya's rapists too. No more wasting of tax payers money on such monsters.
549	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Ppl lost faith in Indian judiciary else that many ppl would not have gathered. All public lawyer and judge should be beaten and removed from post for delaying the verdict. System is making mockery of ppl by calling fast track court on public money. Naga ppl did best thing.
550	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Government of India should learn a lesson otherwise such incidents are bound to happen more and more in future. My reverence to the public of Dimapur‼! Our legal system and police are made to defend and save the criminals and not to help the victims. In Nirbhya's case, the whole India came out in the streets to ask for a death penalty against those brutal criminals. Despite that, the Honourable Supreme court of India are safeguarding these criminals and not even giving a hearing in this case. And look at those two shameless lawyers defending such brutality and challenging to burn the women in their own family! Our new PM came to power with the promise of change. It is time to act NOW and not have this wretched system to always defend the criminals and join them in cruelty against women or other innocent persons or nation in general. Government of India is brutal to its tax payers when it even does not imprison big financial criminals like Neera Yadav, Pandit Yadav, Arvind Joshi and thousands of others who are looting the country. India, beware!!! . Give its citizens right to justice.
551	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If government does not act on time then this is what is going to happen. If things are not addressed, you will very soon find Tihar jail will be broken into.
552	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Great. Although it is apalling to see public taking law in their hands, it feels like this was necessary. Nagaland has conveyed a message loud and clear. This will go a long way in preventing such crimes
553	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is to be done to all the rapist...burn them alive.....great work nagaland people
554	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Rape accused dragged out of jail, lynched in Nagaland
555	2015-03-06 00:00:00	delayed justice, inadequate punishment , and protection of criminals by politicians, police and advocates under influence of money and other influences ,people have lost faith in judicial system. so it is not surprising that frustrated public take law and order in their hands
556	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This Happens when PEOPLE keep waiting for JUSTICE. INDIA is moving towards TALIBAN RAJ. A BIG SHAME..Courts/judges are overburdened, Unemployed are sitting at home doing nothing, Government is sleeping on all this.. So ultimately this is bound to happen and now people have started taking law in their Hand.
557	2015-03-06 00:00:00	We cannot approve of people taking law into their own hands. But in such instances they are forced to as the Indian Courts, including the Supreme Court of India, have shown great reluctance in awarding punishments to those who perpetrate violence against women.  Even in the rarest of rare cases where death sentences have been awarded, the SC has groundlessly stayed the carrying out of such sentences.  It is not good for the society.  The quantum of punishments for outraging the esteem and modesty of women is clearly stipulated in the Indian Penal Code. Courts have to simply pronounce punishments once the guilt of the accused is proved.  The government should quickly bring about drastic reforms in the Justice System so antisocial elements are punished under the stringent provisions of law and people do not have to come out to the streets to dispense justice themselves.
558	2015-03-06 00:00:00	nirvaya rapist also deserve same treatment
559	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When the judicial and law-enforcing agencies fail, people take law into their own hands.  It is not surprising. Vande Matharam.
560	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what must be done to rapists. They have no fear of judicial system.
561	2015-03-06 00:00:00	very good if it was the right man.
562	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Since the judiciary systems takes ages to decide and give verdicts to criminals. Its high time that we , the general public should take up the procedure and give judgement and punishment like this fellow got. Well done people of Nagaland, We sincerly hope that they had over the criminals of Nirbhaya to the public for the judgement as well
563	2015-03-06 00:00:00	nice and swift decision
564	2015-03-06 00:00:00	A good work/action by people who have lost their trust in Law and judiciary because of unneccesary prolonging the cases till they are either forgotten or have attenuated because manipulated evidences.We can't hope wonder from new Govt in the Centre but it has to increase policing in all states and pull them alongwith judiciary to work effectly.Indian police is the most shabby,indecent,indisciplines and lethargic in the whole developing and developed world.There is inflated concern and propaganda about Nirbhaya rape case while every minute a rape takes place in India and most of the times accompanied with hineous crime of physical torture and even killing.Every woman/girl that goes under such crime must be treated no less than Nirbhaya.The culprits must be very seriously punished and perferable will be hang to death.If not done there will be many such public actions under frustration caused by failure of corrupt police and juduciary.
565	2015-03-06 00:00:00	But it must be well known that had suhhil sinde not given permission for filmcrew to shoot film this utterly horrandous event of glorifying mukes crimmes would not take place..Thus not only mukes must be punised now but also that corrupted adasshh scamster sushhil sinde,, must be punnised with mukes.
566	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The long suppressed anger finally finds it vent. Bound to happen.
567	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Muslim Rape Jihad continues. Read about Rotherham in UK &amp; Oxfordshire.
568	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good. Let the Nirbhaya culprits out of the jail and let the people of Delhi decide, as the people of Dimapur decided today in a similar case of rape.
569	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is madness. That man could've been innocent. And if he was guilty, let the law handle it. Mob justice is no justice at all.
570	2015-03-06 00:00:00	From a distance yes. But if you are living it and if you get to read rape reports everyday, and hardly no action is being taken by the LAW enforcers, the mob might burst and jump in and that is what happened. A wake up call to the slumbering judicial system of the country.
571	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Delhi do the same to Nirbhaiya culprits.
572	2015-03-06 00:00:00	But it must be well known that had suhhil sinde not given permission for filmcrew to shoot film this utterly horrandous event of glorifying mukes crimmes would not take place..Thus not only mukes must be punised now but also that corrupted adasshh scamster sushhil sinde must be, punnised with mukes..
573	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This has happened before in NE. But this time it is more serious as the person was  taken out Central Jail paraded for 8 kms and killed. This is the state of law and order in our country and a precursor of things to come.
574	2015-03-06 00:00:00	OwaISI or OwaISIS BETTER BE CAREFUL,
575	2015-03-06 00:00:00	the nirbhaya rap ists and the uber cabbie are still alive with no fear or remorse ... whereas this rap ist has got a spine chilling punishment ... which option looks better?
576	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am representing this issue since last 2 years, informing Union Govt &amp; State govt that Rape cases are fast increasing in our country , last time UPA govt came out with some amendment in laws after massive public outrage, however modifications failed , rape incidents have gone up. Second no one can tolerate rape over Minors , however such cases are too increasing. Govt remains ineffective ,so in such cases Public outrage is bound to be surfaced
577	2015-03-06 00:00:00	'wake up supreme court of India ' A time will come when liars (lawyers) judges and other people in the profession of illegalities will have to run away from the country for delaying justice deliberately and then clearing scoundrels. Dimapur has  shown the way from the NE  as to how to run the judicial administration system of the country which is presently wretched and no chance of coming to its senses ! Congrats to the students and other activists of Dimapur.
578	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good job ... that's how you instill fear
579	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It just shows people's lack of faith in the judiciary and the prosecution process. Our system is hostile to victims of crime and very considerate towards all types of criminals.
580	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good move
581	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good ... the Fellow was an illegal immigrant and a rap ist at that ... and a car dealer ... how emboldened was he to carry out all these activities ... is it not a sign of the rot that has crept in our government and security establishment
582	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The common man is scared of the police and has lost faith in judiciary. The two factors have created a situation where the masses have started taking law in their own hands. The police and judiciary, both, should not take it as their failure but try to do their duty with due respect to public sentiments otherwise more and more such incidents may take place. The villages may turn into jungle and the naxalism may become way of justice.
583	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I don't think that those people to grate job but if the government nothing do againts the rapist then that wil do the normal people ...
584	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Where were the security people?
585	2015-03-06 00:00:00	INSTANT JUSTICE
586	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Perfect Justice done... now people of Kohima has send a direct message to rapists... bad guys will think 100 times before doing such crime...
587	2015-03-06 00:00:00	JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAYS S  JUDICIAL SYSTEM WHERE THE RAPE VICTIM SUFFERSVAND THE RAPIST  ESCAPES PUNISHMENT THROUGH SOME LOOP HOLES IN LAW .SO SUCH ACTIONS AND PUNISHMENT IS NECESSARY.
588	2015-03-06 00:00:00	he deserves so. Delhi rapists all including "Mukesh" deserves more. but ...?
589	2015-03-06 00:00:00	A 7 mile route to death was still a simple death. For rapists there should be a special cell where prisoners are kept in solitary and the cell should be filled with feces and dead rats and the rapist put in that cell till his last. Show them hell before going there.
590	2015-03-06 00:00:00	welll done N.E
591	2015-03-06 00:00:00	needs to be replicated pan lndia!
592	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good  now all of you go to delhi and other states to carryout such  swift  justice
593	2015-03-06 00:00:00	In my knowledge 1st time nagas has done something great. Still they have burnt non-nagas shop. Illetrate people.
594	2015-03-06 00:00:00	We should respect law b'cos if everybody will start taking law in his hand for everything, bypassing the govt low, think what would be the outcome
595	2015-03-06 00:00:00	it was all out of anger! people are just fed up with the everyday news of rapes and do not really agree with the punishments like life time imprisonment for a crime like rape.
596	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what is needed to be done for Nirbahya criminals
597	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Congratulations to the people of Nagaland.  You lead the way, hope the Indians learn from you and follow in your footsteps.
598	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Why make noise....u could not do the job so people took the responsibility of completing the uncompleted job.
599	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Vigilante justice! People have realised that the wheels of justice move very slowly.
600	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This will send shivers up the spine of potential rapists!
601	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what our peace loving victimised people of north east do in their home state,and play the victim card in mainland India.they want to be protected in metro cities by the police force and commit such a horrendous act of lawlessness against the same force in their own states.This is why this states are in a state of  insurgency and lawlessness.only bafoons of the first order can support such acts.
602	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good work. India is proud of You. Well done!, the great society of Nagaland. All the rapist should be treated like this.
603	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The rapist was a muslim from bangla desh as per reports The anger of tne people against the muslim migrants is always there in that area Rape added fuel to fire
604	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Come to Delhi n do the same to the NIRBHAYA accused. In Saudi Arabia that part of the rapist is chopped. Same should be done in India.
605	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Excellent news indeed !!! The Dimapuris have shown us the way to bring down crime against women in a very effective. way  With this I am sure that we will see a dramatic fall in the crime rate against women in Dimapur and also in Nagaland. If this treatment was done with the Nirbhaya murderers , today Delhi would have been a safer place for women
606	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Gr8 people of Nagaland. Thumbs up. Best Holi I belive. Wish I was a part of that mob. Well done nagas. Balle Balle
607	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Perhaps the mob might have been influenced by the BBC documentary controversy.  They probably did not wish to see the accused lecturing on morality and ethics in another BBC documentary!
608	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Awsummmm way...superb...this is the only way left to deal wid such terrorists
609	2015-03-06 00:00:00	because of indian law people has to do this.its is a revoulation may god bless the people of nagaland.
610	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what happens when people have lost belief in justice
611	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People of Dimapur have sentenced in their own court , since judiciary court only permits time -time to rapist &amp; govt. premits to  interview  journalist as in case of Nirbhaya ' s case.Both appeared  as loss of humanity sence.
612	2015-03-06 00:00:00	That's the way to goo.....if rapists are not hanged, they wont be forgiven at all, and  people will take the Law into their hands for getting justice if the Judciary fails in its work.
613	2015-03-06 00:00:00	With the corrupt system, Insensitive Police, Delayed Justice, this type of things are bound to happen. Instant Justice is wanted by the public.
614	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The rapist was not an Indian..go to bbc website to see his original country and ethnicity..nobody is gonna be surprised.
615	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I do not understand why the Nirbhaya rape killers are still not hanged. They delivered speedy justice but his conviction has not yet executed because of the stay by the court. People want instant justice in such cases..........
616	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It is still wrong to take law into your own hands. In a democracy, an accused must have his day in court. This here is nothing but the law of the jungle. In a scenario like this, people can make false accusations against a person they don't like and incite the mob to exact revenge.
617	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This was indeed waiting to happen.How long do we have to tolerate this incompetent judicial system????
618	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Not only in Delhi but all over India. When justice is not delivered people take law in their hands. Why so much delay in implementing court verdict in Nirbhaya case?
619	2015-03-06 00:00:00	At the rate things are going this is what we will soon see in Delhi too.
620	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what happens when people have lost belief in justice............
621	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Instant justice
622	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good news. This public lynching should be a part of Indian CRPC. After a man is convicted of rape, he should be handed over to a crowd for being lynched to death. All these Nirbhaya rapists deserve this and more.
623	2015-03-06 00:00:00	We'll done.we must do this as judiciary has failed in this country and is highly pro criminals.we will have to kill wild animals if we want to live in civilised way in this country
624	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the accusation is proved, this is the best solution to reduce rape in India. Else we will have to wait for years for justice and the rape accused will be giving interviews even after 3 years!
625	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I congratulate the mob. But they could have waited till he is proven guilty. After proven guilty no one have to wait for his prison term to complete
626	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Happy that the rapist is dead.  Sad that an innocent lost his life.
627	2015-03-06 00:00:00	"The accused had allegedly raped the victim several times on February 23 and was arrested the following day following a complaint lodged by the victim.  The police resorted to blank firing and fired tear gas shells but failed to control the situation, officials said.  READ ALSO: One rape every 30 minutes in India  The accused was dragged naked to the main town and he died of the injuries of beatings by the public, a senior official said."  SO A MAN WHO WAS MERELY ACCUSED WAS BEATEN TO DEATH, BUT INDIA TIMES DECIDES TO AMELIORATE THE INJUSTICE AND TRAGEDY BY ASSERTING  THERE'S ONE RAPE EVERY 30 MINUTES.  SICKENING JOURNALISTIC MALPRACTICE.
628	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Mob justice cannot be justified. Agree our judiciary and legal system itself is a big hurdle, but what will happen if all of us start taking taking law in our own hands. Was the accused even given an opportunity to state his side of the story.
629	2015-03-06 00:00:00	A good decision by public. After new law against rapiests ..rape incidents are increasing day by day. People involved in such crimes need speedy trail &amp; death penality .But it is not happening. Well this incident is warning to such people &amp; to government....
630	2015-03-06 00:00:00	He had it coming. Well done people of Nagaland. The cabinet should have condemned the long and slow process of law, which led the people to take the law in their own hands.
631	2015-03-06 00:00:00	public have lost belief in justice
632	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what must be done with all rapists, why spend tax-payers money keeping them in prison in comfort, this is called Kangaroo court justice.
633	2015-03-06 00:00:00	RApe in Naga society, or any NE society, is unknown. Such culture should not be allowed toproliferate from the mainland
634	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The rapist was a bangladeshi muzlim. north-east ppl can never do such a henious act...go to bbc website.
635	2015-03-06 00:00:00	that's the least Indian people can do when our transgender. politicians, police and stupid courts of Indian failed to act and always gave orders in favor or rapist. criminals. murderers. because these four kinds of people are the most corrupt, and criminal in Indian society.
636	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Either take action on one rapist or take action against 10 thousands peoples, law makers has to thinks. But punishment is given.
637	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Those ministers &amp; politicians who practice  VVIP culture daily also shall face people's anger in future.
638	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When the Law is not in your hands culprits can have all the luxury and loopholes of Indian Judicial system.  But when public takes Law in to their hands, the verdict is instant and ultimate.  For once, because of the increasing number of rapes in the country, I appreciate the public for their action.  Rapists - beware !!!
639	2015-03-06 00:00:00	not a sign of healthy society.. our sisters needs feel more safe and secure..
640	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Where govts refuse to act, people take over
641	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It may be wrong as per the rule. But it happen frequently in same way by victim common people will give the right signal in appropriate  way to deter the prospective rapist  in shortest possible time in positive way.
642	2015-03-06 00:00:00	a revolution. incredible things still happen in india.
643	2015-03-06 00:00:00	hope he is the actual culprit. Not a blank fill up by police to produce in court. There are many situation when police could not nab the culprit. They will put wrong cases against petty criminals as there is alwaus quo pro between them.
644	2015-03-06 00:00:00	without supporting rapist. the naga dog eating people treat north Indians even worst when we visit there. these half nepali half chinese people really think Indians as foriegner.
645	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Taking law in hand is wrong but when so called protector of law is sleeping or busy with protecting law breaker this kind of reaction from people bound to happen. This is wake up call for judiciary n police.
646	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Really fast tracked.
647	2015-03-06 00:00:00	in reply to some comments. a Indian (since n.e people are considered foreigners) shopkeeper in nagaland is 80 times safer than a student in New Delhi. The 20 is a discrimination but itll be ensured when immigrants are differentiated from fellow countrymen(i'd argue). what if a naga buisnessman is accused of rape in mainland (a place like dimapur) or even New Delhi. not asserting the lynching was right.
648	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is for all the wrongs done to men and women from NE!!
649	2015-03-06 00:00:00	WOOOOHOOOO!! l feel so elated... :)
650	2015-03-06 00:00:00	In yester years the court houses were FULL to listen to the Defence lawyers' dirty questions put to the rape vicitms...the ppor women shrank with shame....this lynching is priseowrthy....here some moron Staysh.pramanik pramanik sid something about RSS...this pramanik must be from the ka=tte=la kaum....ISIS RAPES NON-SUNNI WOMEN DAY IN AND DAY OUT...Hi prmanik you must be knowing that your pay-gumber raped every one that came along (in the name of Allah)..may be his own mother !!!! The DIRTY politicians may face the same fate for RAPING MY COUNTRY FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS !!!
651	2015-03-06 00:00:00	kill dis rapist!!!,well done nagas!!! Bravo !!!
652	2015-03-06 00:00:00	In the absence of timely police action to prevent rapes and other crimes and justice not being given by judiciary this is the only option left with public. Judiciary and police dept should be disbanded.with the present style they are of no use to the public. They are only there for the VVIP. Well done
653	2015-03-06 00:00:00	that is community justice, the more time it takes the citizen, political powers, and police to take things seriously, there will always be a uprising where people take the final decisions
654	2015-03-06 00:00:00	this is awesome, and should be done very very often...
655	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If our judicial system cannot stand for victims. People will. I am proud of those people. It was a fight between law and dharma, dharma prevailed - which is right.
656	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Weldone Nagas. Your methodology needs replication in most of the rapist and hard core crimiinals living till date because of the stupid and flawed policy of bail not jail by the Supreme Court of India. Judicial system in India only exists for likes of Teestas and Tej Tarun Pal who exploit it with collusion of majority judges whose only aim is to mint money by keeping the high profile criminals away from jails by wrongly extending the interpretation of liberty. This approach of judges has made police impotent as it leaves police with practically nothing to make the culprit admit his crime. Basic fault lies with the judges of the Supreme Court who have reduced the criminal jurisprudence in India to mere joke.
657	2015-03-06 00:00:00	There will be maybe no more rapes in Nagaland. It does not mean that the women are safe.Some are shameless.
658	2015-03-06 00:00:00	rape is crime of hate and is probably related to childhood trauma of watching women being abused and dehumanized
659	2015-03-06 00:00:00	when justice is not given on time this is what will happen
660	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Wow wat a good judgement by public :)
661	2015-03-06 00:00:00	"But at the same day, the news of gang-rape of a 10-year old Lower Caste Untouchable Dalit girl and who was burnt subsequently was tucked away in the inside pages devoting only five to ten lines" --Kabir, former Chief Justice of India
662	2015-03-06 00:00:00	People should punish him
663	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Enough people wait... justice is delayed. Police &amp; judiciary should be charged for relaxing.
664	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Govt and Courts must be relieved.
665	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Swift justice.
666	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Just bcoz of weakness in our system... we are racing towards the stone age. From rule of law to jungle raj.
667	2015-03-06 00:00:00	well done
668	2015-03-06 00:00:00	what public did is right...of one waits for law to have its way , it may take years to punish a culprit...court hearings will go on and when the court awards death sentence some human right organisation will into picture and file a plea petition for that person....atleast in rape cases the results should be in days and not years...
669	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Khangress lost one voter.
670	2015-03-06 00:00:00	PM we want answer... what steps your Govt has initiated for Women security??? We hear rape cases every day but no news abt Govt plans to increase security for women....
671	2015-03-06 00:00:00	More like this will happen if our justice system takes years to deliver its verdict. NGO's will start supporting such rapists who get lynched, not focusing on protesting against judiciary in delaying justice.
672	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Are people losing their faith in law enforcement? Seems so. But such things are not good for the country and earlier the Governments realise the same it shall be good.
673	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is in way good and also bad, taking law in hands is bad part, but if court does punish the offenders what else you expect from the public.
674	2015-03-06 00:00:00	PM is too busy fighting to get his Land bill pass!!!! what is happening to women security bill???? PM has not even initiated any new steps towards this..... we want answer......
675	2015-03-06 00:00:00	public have lost belief in justice.
676	2015-03-06 00:00:00	I am sure some policeman must have helped with their sticks, as they too know that justice take too long in our system....
677	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is what these devils deserve. Delhites must do the same to reduce the recurrence of Rape in Delhi. 1st to start with the Family members and the lawyers of the rapist! But in Delhi we doubt there are men?
678	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This was indeed waiting to happen.How long do we have to tolerate this incompetent judicial system?
679	2015-03-06 00:00:00	despite of every day such incidents our Govt has not come up with any strict law against such crime... there are millions of cases pending in our courts against such criminals and these criminals are living freely and committing such crime with out worries... when will our system will ever change???? where are the promises of Narendra Modi ???
680	2015-03-06 00:00:00	stringent n sevier punishment has to b frame against rapist. tis is wat he deserve.
681	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Though in Indian constitution no such provision exist to take such action by biting to death,but human sentiments run high.During my tour to Nagaland I noticed that.
682	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Give death penalties to the rapists. Lets start with MPs/MLAs who have criminal record. Swacchh Bharat
683	2015-03-06 00:00:00	good idea
684	2015-03-06 00:00:00	it shows how fast people are losing faith in justice system.the case of nirbhyaa is the best example.
685	2015-03-06 00:00:00	if our judiciary would have given this kind of punishment, lack of trust in our system has caused the people to take law in their own hands. congratulate Naga people who have shown extra ordinary courage
686	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Street justice or vigilante justice should neither be tolerated nor encouraged. It has no place in civil society. Howsoever heinous the crime, the accused must be punished only according to the process of law.
687	2015-03-06 00:00:00	when it takes years to give justice. .. people trend to take law in their own hand. ...remove backlog of 3 crores case
688	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Naga people themselves have taken law into their own hands to severely punish the rapist.Good avenging.let the Law now take its own case.
689	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is to be taken as warning bell by Judiciary Police and the Politians. Deliver justice fast people are losing faith in the system do not wait and test the peoples patients.
690	2015-03-06 00:00:00	If the govt fails to frame a policy, implement a policy, do justice............ with all resources it has with people's money...... people eventually will take control... Don't see anything wrong... Infact, action has to be taken against the people failing govt to act !!!
691	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Janta ka faisla ...
692	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This the example of the result of justice delayed . The govt should reform police and court process for early judgement .
693	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Come on media, speak out, why hide the identity, rapist's name is Syed Sirf Khan and he is a bangladeshi immigrant. When will this media and opposition loose its sympathy for bangladeshi immigrants that stem only and only from the fact that they are muslims.
694	2015-03-06 00:00:00	When polity, bureaucracy, policing and judiciary let down people - this is what happens next. Are any of these groups listening??
695	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The incompetent/corrupt/coward police force of India is ONLY responsible for this state of affairs. Secondly the govt. The govt should give a free hand to police to beat public black and blue if they create any civil unrest. Also the police should stop harassing innocent people. The situation is fast becoming dangerous as the public nowadays are least concerned about laws as they know that nothing can happen to them.
696	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The rapist deserved it.But I think he is not only responsible for that type of crime .For that, the government the agent of Capital class , The media for their sex attractive advertisement and the film industry whose make the unsocial film and we are also responsible for that type of crime because  we forget our social responsibility.
697	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Jungle law now
698	2015-03-06 00:00:00	JANTA JUSTICE ON SPOT
699	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is extremely inhuman. For those of u applauding this act, please remember that outsiders (including Mainland Indians) are treated in this manner in the NE. Was an investigation done? Tomorrow would be ur turn to face the music on the mere complaint of a girl. I understand that the Nirbhaya incident has totally brainwashed the people's mentality, yet remember not all cases are similar. After the accused was killed, his body was dragged on a bike for 2 kms and then burnt. If this is human, then God bless
700	2015-03-06 00:00:00	HANG all the RAPIST and ISIS..Scum of the Earth.
701	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Better punishment for the rape accused than Nirbhaya case....
702	2015-03-06 00:00:00	It is good in one way as no police, no court etc and instant justice. bad because if the man is not the culprit or the accusation is false.
703	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is exactly what should happen to incidents like these... People are no longer patient to see justice being delivered! The Nirbhaya case has been long pending till now and the incidents coming post the hideous event is drastic to hear!!! Good work guys, this should ring a bell to all the candidate rapists!!!
704	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good work by the public be it... such should be fate of all the rapists in india to avoid more rape crimes.. I am with people and appreciate what they didd
705	2015-03-06 00:00:00	yes, people are doing what govt has to do. real shame on govt
706	2015-03-06 00:00:00	A mob in Nagaland barged into the Dimapur Central Jail on Thursday afternoon, dragged out a rape accused and lynched him. Police said the mob overpowered jail security, tied up the man and dragged him for seven kilometres, thrashing him along the way. By the end, he succumbed to his injuries. Later in the evening, curfew was imposed in Dimapur town following incidents of arson. “The situation is grim. The rape accused is said to be an illegal Bangladeshi infiltrator,” Nagaland DGP L L Doungel, who rushed from Kohima to Dimapur, said. He added that a few arrests had been made. The victim has been identified as 35-year-old Syed Farid Khan, a small-time trader who dealt in scrap and used motor cars. The incident triggered a backlash against Bangladeshi immigrants, with houses and shops run by them coming under attack. RELATED Abducted Dimapur Schoolboy Freed As Traders Protest,Nagaland Wakes Up To Extortion Menace To Avoid Rape,Stop Dressing  Indecently : Naga Women S Body Incidentally, the state has been in the grip of an agitation over the issue of illegal immigrants for the past two weeks. According to reports, despite Section 144 being imposed in Dimapur since Wednesday evening, the Naga Students’ Federation (NSF) and some other local groups called a rally on Thursday to protest against the alleged rape. In the afternoon, a mob rushed to the jail, broke open the gates by overpowering the security personnel on duty. Khan was stripped, tied up and dragged to City Clock Tower area — being kicked and pelted with stones along the way. Khan was accused of raping a student of a local women’s college on February 24. The NSF and other groups had earlier demanded that he should not be granted bail. When police turned up to remove Khan’s body, the mob started pelting stones, injuring several personnel. The police then resorted to lathi charge and opened fire. The mob also set an Indian Reserve Battalion bus on fire. The mob then headed to Purana Bazar area, where the rape-accused had his shop, and reportedly set several shops and houses on fire. Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang, who is in New Delhi, called up senior ministers and officers, following which a government statement was issued asking people to show restraint. As visuals of the lynching started doing the rounds, the state government requested the media not to share them — in a bid to prevent any more violence. “Many ugly, objectionable pictures are already on social media, but the traditional media, which is available more widely, has been requested to be more sensitive and apply self censorship to help mitigate the possible ramifications,” the appeal read.

708	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This is very good. This treatment should be given to rapists and illegal intruders from Bangladesh. No punishment should be given to brave and bold killers. They must be given clemency as the nation has been given to terrorists in the name of healing touch and bringing back in the mainstream of the nation.
709	2015-03-06 00:00:00	The rapist deserved it.But I think he is not only responsible for that type of crime. For it  , the government the agent  of Capital class,  The media for their sex attractive advertisement  and the film industry whose make the unsocial film. ...........And We are also responsible for that because  we forgot our responsibility for society.
710	2015-03-06 00:00:00	This had to happen some time or the other and Govt should have anticipated this ! The reason is simple because the menace of rape or rape and murder or rape and torture in continuing unabated despite the public uproar for the last 2   years post Nirbhaya 's rape/ murder case in Delhi. The Govt is not acting tough in enacting the laws and still or dilly dallying on the issue of quantum and severity of punishment and the juvenile laws which surely needs amendment. The judiciary is not acting tough and even not enforcing current law based sentences to make it severe . So what would the hapless society do except taking law into their own hands ? This should have been avoided at any cost since there could be possibility of wrong guys getting lynched !
711	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Naga justice is awaiting for fundamental politicians as well!
712	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Let the truth be heard. The real story is that the alleged rapist is not the rapist. No rape was committed. That woman was a prostitute who filed rape charge to police simply because the alleged rapist paid less money. Shame nagas!! taking innocent live!! Myself a naga feeling ashamed.
713	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Good job... request BBC to publicize Worldwide this event too... may be lot of rapists start feeling terrified
714	2015-03-08 00:00:00	well said. But the ONLY solution to deal with RAPE is  FAMILY education and value education ! each parent must bring up kids in  such a manner that he or she Never thinks of exploiting the other  physically or mentally and this character is ingrained into their DNA by  basic life style n moral education ! until then there shall be problems  . MoreOver  It is obvious there was a "collusion between Police and  Mobsters" and the "Ghar Wapsi Terrorists" (GWT)
715	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Under the situation of very slow delivery of court  justice, when mob thinks that lynching is the alternative, can they be  blamed? MoreOver The sea between India and Lanka is very narrow. In  between the Kachatheevu is also there. If you stand at the Dhanuskodi  you can see the Kachatheevu. It is very difficult to maintain the  territory. For both the country it is better that the fishermen from  both the countries should be allowed to fish irrespective of border  territory and the only solution for this only that Indian fishermen  should be allowed in Lanka north where Tamils are residing as well as  Laknan fishermen should be allowed in India at Ramanathapuram and nearby  districts with out any document and by only a special identity card by  both the countries. Kachatheevu also taken back from Lanka and lease  agreement should be cancelled. The Indian army should take up the  regular checkup and sea rounds instead of Lankan navvy now doing.  MoreOver  Lets see how your reaction if your father or brother is  lynched by mob based on false accusation. Not saying this man was  falsely accused but even he is the rapist mob lynching is not the way to  go unless we want to go back few hundred years and again if you hate  India so much please leave and do not come back I will glad to pay for  your ticket and take your traiterous family with you, the first question  your male relatives at port of entry will be asked is how many rapes  today mate? Hope they can lie and say 0
716	2015-03-08 00:00:00	well said, a serious issue n need to approach them in a  calibrated manner as well as multi pronged approach is needed ! MoreOver   This is not a lynching of an individual.. but a slap on our judicial  system and the slow working of the system delivery..!

718	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It's clearly a tight slap on our slow and stubborn  judicial system. In most cases the victims themselves give up fed up  with the system.
719	2015-03-07 00:00:00	People are often angry with this and that for acts of  commission and omission that have caused them immense discomfort and  unease. Can the disaffected people be allowed to take the law I. Their  hand. MoreOver  Right wing elements made it a communal issue and  instigated mobs to commit this crime and kill the rapist. The Govt.  should charge and arrest the guilty instigators.

721	2015-03-07 00:00:00	point taken, but the Govt can do noting in an act  resulting from Mob frenzy ! we INDIANS need to guard exactly against  this ! Our govt / police will be the first to RUN AWAY when the uprising  happens and courts will as usual close their gates ! we in our society  need to DEMAND better political / police / Judicial personnel and we  need to upgrade ourselves too morally n ethically and learn to be MORE  tolerant !
722	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Mobs don't just show up and kill people on their own.  There are always people who arrange and incite mobs to attack and kill  persons. Govt. Must charge and arrest the people who incited and led to  kill persons.
723	2015-03-07 00:00:00	normally yes, but a rape in a naga community is not as  common as it is for a delhite or a Haryanvi or UP wala. To attribute  everything to inctiment or politics and NOT looking inward is foolish !  What Govt are we talking about by the way ? what judiciary as we  discussing as well ? 31000 plus rape cases pending for decades even ! u  expect this Govt or system to react n react positive ? killing is NOT  done, whether by a lynch mob or Politician induced encounter or by a  over jealous police cop or even by the judiciary as that involves LIFE  and that NO ONE produce and hence must not touch it too!
724	2015-03-07 00:00:00	u seem a arm chair critic of events which is good but not  practical ! have u seen a rape victim suffer internal n societal  humiliation ? please take time out n go n talk to some ! with this kind  of police attitude n lethargic judiciary, wont be surprised if u have a  change of hearts !
725	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagaland has no right wing but Christians and this is the beginning  of war between Naga christains and  Bangladeshi muslims.

727	2015-03-07 00:00:00	guess we r not here to abuse people in an uncivil manner ? please advise or be critical, but restrain from abusing ! anyone !

Those  who are supporting this, please imagine if every person resorts to this  kind of revenge justice, (parallel judiciary) there will be complete  anarchy. Hypothetically, if he is not found guilty, how will the society  compensate the deceased ?. The dispensing with justice must follow the  due procedure, set there in.. Still  It is good that the state  government has ordered a judicial inquiry. This incident. Is the ugliest  in its nature. It demanded an inquiry commission led by a High Cour  judge. Still Bangladeshi r biggest concern in north east India.
729	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Public anger against illegal Bangladeshi has been brewing  for quite some time. This incidence has just triggered the frustration  to the level, it ought not have. The situation in Nagaland concerning  these IBI is not much different than what is in Bodoland in Assam before  people take up the armed struggle against them. Time to tread carefully  to solve this vexed issue..
730	2015-03-07 00:00:00	well said, a serious issue n need to approach them in a calibrated manner as well as multi pronged approach is needed !
731	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The only identity of the man who was lynched to death is a  rapists.  The religion, state, country, caste or creed simply does not  matter.
732	2015-03-07 00:00:00	he was not bangalsdeshi but from Assam nor he was a bengali
733	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is precisely the core of the issue that these IBI  have somehow everything to prove their origin of Assam, whereas people  there know they are not. The other side of this is that even they are  IBI, being people of Indian origin, they are legitimately entitled to a  settlement in India on humanitarian ground. The Govt. has a role and  obligation to regularise such millions of people with some kind of  status than to allow them acquire the same by illegal means which the  son of the soil know better who is and who is not a native of their land  than any of us outsiders.
734	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Bangladeshi r biggest concern in north east India.

746	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These sort of incidents will be on the rise because  people are getting fed up of our corrupt and inefficient judicial  system. Cases seem to drag on in courts forever and many of our learned  Judges pocket money and other favours  by the warring parties to ensure  delays. Even the so called fast track court hearing the Nirbhaya rape  case in Delhi is dragging its feet for the last two years and no final  decision seems to be be forthcoming. After this the case will surely go  to the SC which is another institution which delays decision making---  the BCCI case of Srinivasan and CSK/Rajasthan Royals is a recent example  when the SC seems to favour one commission after another to probe  something which needs no further probe.!! The patience of the nation is  running thin by these delays in Justice and very soon we might see more  rapists and other criminal offenders  being lynched by the public. !!!
747	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No wonder why the mob of about 20,000 Nagaland citizens  have that dragged a man out of the jail to beat him to death...!!!  Thanks for taking the charge, else the justice would've never been  delivered by our snail pace Indian Judicial System!!!

MOB TAKES THE LAW IN THEIR  HANDS ONLY WHEN THEY HAVE LOST FAITH IN JUDICIARY......
764	2015-03-08 00:00:00	guess we r not here to abuse people in an uncivil manner ?  please advise or be critical, but restrain from abusing ! anyone !  MoreOver  It is obvious there was a "collusion between Police and  Mobsters" and the "Ghar Wapsi Terrorists" (GWT)
765	2015-03-08 00:00:00	point taken, but the Govt can do noting in an act  resulting from Mob frenzy ! we INDIANS need to guard exactly against  this ! Our govt / police will be the first to RUN AWAY when the uprising  happens and courts will as usual close their gates ! we in our society  need to DEMAND better political / police / Judicial personnel and we  need to upgrade ourselves too morally n ethically and learn to be MORE  tolerant ! Also  This is the classic case of travesty of justice. Those  who are supporting this, please imagine if every person resorts to this  kind of revenge justice, (parallel judiciary) there will be complete  anarchy. Hypothetically, if he is not found guilty, how will the society  compensate the deceased ?. The dispensing with justice must follow the  due procedure, set there in..
766	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mobs don't just show up and kill people on their own.  There are always people who arrange and incite mobs to attack and kill  persons. Govt. Must charge and arrest the people who incited and led to  kill persons. he was only accused crime is not proven Also Muslim yes,  Brown yes bearded yes, rapist yes.. American no way..... Still  NDA  government at the center has deliberately created a hostile environment  for the Muslims.

Cases seem to drag on in courts  forever and many of our learned Judges pocket money and other favours  by the warring parties to ensure delays. Even the so called fast track  court hearing the Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi is dragging its feet for  the last two years and no final decision seems to be be forthcoming.  After this the case will surely go to the SC which is another  institution which delays decision making--- the BCCI case of Srinivasan  and CSK/Rajasthan Royals is a recent example when the SC seems to favour  one commission after another to probe something which needs no further  probe.!! The patience of the nation is running thin by these delays in  Justice and very soon we might see more rapists and other criminal  offenders being lynched by the public. !!!

809	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The people who lynched this rapists to death did a  commendable job and they should be congratulated.  The police, the  judiciary and the jail authorities in India seem to be rather  incompetent.  Justice delayed in justice denied.

825	2015-03-07 00:00:00	u r right there is no need for courts and judges governament and education we can live like people in Afghanistan and somalia
826	2015-03-07 00:00:00	if they are working it is fine but they act only for rich and politicians others have to wait for 10-20 yrs.
827	2015-03-07 00:00:00	yes u r right there is need for fast track courts for these crimes but this mob justice cant be approved india is nation of mahatma gandhi and many other great freedom fighter and this is definitely not something they would have wanted to see
828	2015-03-07 00:00:00	While maintaining the high standards of courts,governments and education, your sisters and mothers are not safe.Think from that angle also.
829	2015-03-07 00:00:00	then its time to hold more onto the laws and try to improve them there should be tough laws against false accusations (in this case the lady is absconding) coz if u promote lawlessness u can only expect disastor
830	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Yes courts and judges in India are the puppets of Jayas, Lallus, Ambanis. Courts are meant for them. 24 hours any time the can approach and judges willing to give them relief. Do you know Nirbhaya rapists are in jail because SC stayed their death sentence.  Do you know Ubar rape victim is again called from cross examination on the direction of HC.  You get raped and under go humiliation because of corrupt judges/lawyers/police
831	2015-03-07 00:00:00	and also coz of the fact that our country is against punishing any innocent and that is possible only after giving ample time for the accused and defense to prove things in their favor. india may not be perfect but it is our country and we should work in right direction to improve it.approving these actions will bring us to the level of somalia and afganistan at the international level

846	2015-03-07 00:00:00	a Manipuri rapist was lynched  in a village in Nagaland a few months back and no media coverage! but when a muslim rapist is lynched why this hue and cry??? rapists should indeed be lynched ! but media and the govt should keep quite if they cannt deliver promp justice!

863	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Also possible that you are produced by Draupadi the common wife of the five Pandavas, so you are confused in determining any of those five.
864	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Also it seems that your mother has worshipped the black Lingam to produce you. By the way visit your sisters living in Asaram Aashram.
865	2015-03-07 00:00:00	yep--also your sister and father is fuuuking the holey poophead and togather they are farrrting--Allahuuuuuuuuu--Astagfirullah--Labbaik Allahuma Labbaik

868	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Very unrestrained comment with a communal tinge
869	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Excuse me...He was not a rapist actually. The girl asked him to pay 2 lacks, since he denied to pay the money, she lodged a complaint saying he raped her. Nagaland government also apologized for the incident.
870	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The only identity of this man who was lynched to death is that he is a rapists.  His religion, state, country, caste or creed or even educational qualifications are of no consequence.
871	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Yes I agree
872	2015-03-07 00:00:00	good job this is fastest rape case that is solved by the people . .  give nirbhaya's case to the people they will show how it should be handled  . . .  govt is giving service to these criminals and allowing them to give such stupid interviews
873	2015-03-07 00:00:00	He was not a rapist actually. The girl asked him to pay 2 lacks, since he denied to pay the money, she lodged a complaint saying he raped her. Nagaland government also apologized for the incident.
874	2015-03-07 00:00:00	He Was Bangladeshi..
875	2015-03-07 00:00:00	.. he was Indian ..naam Hindustani likhne se koi  Indian nahi banta.. as per assam newspaper . his father worked with indian air force and his two siblings are working with indian army and posted in kashmir and chattisgarh,,  so keep your mouth shut if you dnt know the truth...
876	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Good Job Mother India--Finally Indians have woke up to Terrorist Moslems and Rapist Moslems and illegal Moslem--send them packing home to Pokistan and Banga--No need baby banger religion and people--Jai Hind
877	2015-03-07 00:00:00	better than courts
878	2015-03-07 00:00:00	That is great.
879	2015-03-07 00:00:00	AUM
880	2015-03-07 00:00:00	it's seems rapist is a sicular and from relgion of peace as no media house is naming him if he would have been a some one else media house would have named him with his picture.  And below some sicular are also sympathetic to rapist so overall its seems rapist might be a sicular with so much media attention with hiding the facts.
881	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Oh the government is again coming forward to protect the criminals. They should give Sabashi to the crowd justice.
882	2015-03-07 00:00:00	How do you know actual rape was happened or not and how do you say the accused was a criminal before trial. Who paid you to bark whenever you get any news. What do you know about the strange culture of Dimapur? There is no need to rape in a city like Dimapur. Any stranger will be accused easily. Do you know how many army men succumbs to these kind of allegations in Dimapur. If any girl start talking to you in this city you must avoid immediately. She will immediately asks you very loudly not to betray and leave her. Several times i myself have encountered these scenarios when I wait for Bus for Imphal. So many doubts are looming in our thoughts if actual rape was happened or not? So do not bark like a paid dog. There is a law in the country to punish the guilty.
883	2015-03-07 00:00:00	bokkka saaale.  How many times people join hands on the support of rape victim?.  Not all right? People know what is right and what is wrong
884	2015-03-07 00:00:00	What if your live in partner accuse you of rape after spending time with you for 2-3 years?
885	2015-03-07 00:00:00	bokka madrch.  People know what is right and what is wrong.  People not joined hands on daily basis when every women get raped.
886	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Ch***ya madrch. You are mentally sick get treatment first
887	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Alerta máxima en Assam, Nagaland después de linchamiento
888	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These guys are good at creating stores, and therefore most of them are in the film industry, though it is a Haraam to sing and dance in public. Tomorrow they will create stores that the father of the rapist was the freedom fighter of India and working with Gandhi and Nehru. Illegal Bangladeshis are a menace for India; they procreate like dogs and pigs, and after filling their land, they started to move to India in search of livelihood; chase these criminals away; they are a big menace for the middle-eastern countries as well; many countries have put a ban on job visas and travel. They will also bring a false birth certificate that the rapist was a juvenile. Someone making stories that Shahrukh Khan's grand dad was a freedom fighter. They will also go on to say that ISIS is a Christian Organisation sponsored by America - master at creating conspiracy theories. They will never accept their crime unless caught red handed, just as Osama was kept in hiding in Pakistan.
889	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Vigilante
890	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is what should happen to every rapist.
891	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Dimpur has shown that their is always light  even if it is a very dark tunnel.
892	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The killers should be rewarded by the President. Ask any raoe victim and she will definitely agree to it.
893	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I love you Nagaland. This is the best way to rid India of Illegal immigrants and rapists.
894	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All rape victims feel so happy reading this news item. Naga treatment of rapists is the best way to get rid of this menace.
895	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is called instant justice for the rape victim!!!
896	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Great job
897	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nothing unfortunate about the incident. Every  rapist should meet the same fate. What is the state apparatus doing to maintain safety and security of common citizen?  He was an illegal immigrant. First state should have not allowed him in. Next he should have been deported. He was instead allowed to remain because some where, some one whose job was to see that there is no illegal immigrant was sleeping on his job
898	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The local incompetent judiciary contributed to the locals taking the law into their hands. If the law had been upheld fairly for the brutalised victim, then the locals would have been contented. It's time the local justice system offers justice to the raped victims. Until then, a precedence has been set by the locals, expect more of such incidents. Some men have no respect for the rights of an individual possibly coz she may belong to the so called 'lower caste'. On this occassion, the public are justified in supporting the local mob. The lower class have dignity &amp; rights too.
899	2015-03-07 00:00:00	THE HIGHEST COURT IS THE PEOPLE'S COURT BLOKE--ASTAGFIRULLAH
900	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Very good, our law only provide security n biryani to criminal/ terrorist and rapist in jail. The case will go on and on .....till public forget.we cant expect anything from our rotten system n spineless leaders , who are good in just giving speach , n offering condolences. Salute to the ppl of dimapur .
901	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The mob had taken right step ...... Only thing is that the person should be hanged, since he had spoiled the life of a women
902	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Unfortunately, he was not a rapist actually. The girl asked him to pay 2 lacks, since he denied to pay the money, she lodged a complaint saying he raped her. Nagaland government also apologized for the incident.
903	2015-03-07 00:00:00	An estimated 2,000 people reportedly took part in the lynching incident.
904	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Dhimapur people has taken very good steps because every one very well known it that INDIAN Law for rapist is useless with unwanted court proceedings and put to embarrassment.
905	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Indiscriminate widespread raping and lynchings reinforces India's global image as a backward and uncivilized society.
906	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The mob did a good job----------Media is making  mountain out of a molehill.
907	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mob killed an innocent.
908	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He was a culprit as per the report?
909	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Let Court decide it. But the investigative reports says the Girl had relation with this man and this man paid money always. When the girl demanded 2 Lakhs, he didn't paid. This black mailing leads to a police complaint. Whatever it is, it is unlawful.
910	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Typical Indian male response: It is the girls fault for being alone in evening. It is the girls fault for wearing revealing dress that forced the innocent man to commit rap*e.
911	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas are a proud and self respecting race.
912	2015-03-09 00:00:00	They are cruel man eaters!
913	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Quiz- Name a Pedo whose name has HAM IN THE MIDDLE ?
914	2015-03-07 00:00:00	it was not rape but consensual sex.The alleged rapist wanted to end the affair which prompted the lady to file a complaint.what a tragic way to die.the savages who killed an innocent man should be punished as per law.
915	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If it was not a rape, the murder is condemnable. But as a warning to the would be rapists and corrupted ministers, it is a good warning.
916	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Sad indeed, As,I 've said, the rapist   should die , but we live in land of law. What ever has to happen had happened, I pray that such incident be never visit our land no more.
917	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The rap*ist was an illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who went to Nagaland to pursue his rap*e dreams. But our "secular" parties will never stop illegal immigration into India from Bangladesh because of muslim vote bank politics.
918	2015-03-07 00:00:00	good work by people...
919	2015-03-07 00:00:00	People particularly our young generation is loosing faith in our judiciary and crime control systems. Cases against criminals caught red handed in crimes and rapists  nabbed remain lingering in the Honb'le Courts for years together and thus justice is not delivered to sufferers. Heart shaking pain expressed by the mother of Nirbhaya in the documentary released  recently shows how pathetic is our judicial and crime control system.
920	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Why this alert ? Against whom? People vs Government ? or People vs Judiciary? As per the people's verdict all over Bharat rapists should be given the severest of punishment by the fastest of court. This was most vociferously expressed by the citizens after the NIRBHAY RAPE-MURDER. Why is it that the elected leaders who are put in power by the same people are being over ruled and the criminals are being protected ? Such riot like people's JUDGEMENT may soon become rampant in the whole nation. Even dragging the erring 'leaders' in open and punishing severely for their sins &amp; utterances. MR MODI the PM please react. Do not procrastinate any more.
921	2015-03-07 00:00:00	* A REQUIEM FOR NIRBHAYA "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey You and I know nothing of Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! But let us all now Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the mega thugs, super criminals and ultra anarchists Behind all these comparatively merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life more and more difficult in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and sick human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like you and me and our kith and kin? What a travesty of justice and fair play That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, plundered and pilfered only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn As a direct result! Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their direct creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Thousands of truly qualified others Have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India and Indians possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives as a nation Despite all the anti-India and anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve them of their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to each and every Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let us all this also now remember!
922	2015-03-07 00:00:00	any time a rape happens, kill the rapist in public Saudi Arabia style. Any time a muslim tries to convert or coerce hindu girl, kill him too.
923	2015-03-07 00:00:00	kill all illegal bangladeshis in india
924	2015-03-07 00:00:00	who told you he was bangladeshi ???
925	2015-03-07 00:00:00	What happened actually In Dimapur Jail ! Either Revolt / Revolution / Angry Mob's act  On 14-7-1789 " B ASTILLE PRISON was damaged. Now History Repeats. Timapur Jail has been attacked by a huge crowd.  It is a good lesson for RAPIST / Intruders / Unlawful social elements.People are watching the day to day affairs in this country. several High Level Police officers, District collector have been suspended in this regard. curfew has been clamped.Matter is serious. Individual fellow ( Rapist 0 had created confusion. The accused was dragged out and was lynched ( Hanging ).  his chapter is over. but Pandemonium prevails. kodeeswaran singapore
926	2015-03-07 00:00:00	For those who are assuming that a naga girl was raped by a bangladeshi, here are some disturbing facts: 1. The girl who filed the complaint, is a cousin of that guy's wife 2. Medical report of the girl does not say she was raped 3. One brother of that guy,  Iman Uddin Khan, had been in the Indian Army, and had been killed in the Kargil conflict in 1999.
927	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The culprit belongs to the religion of PiECE hahahah
928	2015-03-07 00:00:00	because the culprit is a muslim and now u compare with all bad countries and cry for secularism and now show that pig as a great jehadi and now all muslim jehadi and mullas will promise and take revenge from non muslims on name of religion
929	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Decision on SPOT................
930	2015-03-07 00:00:00	To those who says what has happened to the rapist is unfortunate….imagine the same rape incident happens to own family and the trail goes for never ending. And then we all wait for your reactions….boss its very easy to posturize and compare pak and afghan… but very difficult to digest the reality
931	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Will the British make a documentary now?Uam curious. Best treatment of rapists today.
932	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rajnath ji don't act smart ... what kind appropriate action?
933	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Now it is not our females who go around with a victim tag attached to them... But it is those animals that want to victimize females that will go around with a bounty tag on their head... This is the first of many that could happen if the government does not step in to put in a legal process to punish the rapists in the hardest possible manner and the quickest time possible!!
934	2015-03-07 00:00:00	There is no need for high alert. The Bangladeshi immigrants should not forget, what happened to their ilk in Gujarat. The same will follow in Assam and Nagaland, if they try to play smart.
935	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No punishment  can be justified  in such  brutal way at least when crime was not proven.
936	2015-03-07 00:00:00	How can people get in high security jail. Nagaland govt and police officials need to be removed immediately. Nagaland is part of India this cannot be tolerated. It's dangerous for democracy and India as a whole.
937	2015-03-07 00:00:00	by law its wrong, but I think this type of justice required to stop. this kind of incident
938	2015-03-07 00:00:00	To all the people who are appreciating this act and claiming it to be a way to show frustration of our legal system, well they should study our law and other countries' laws. It is one of the best and if u are falsely convicted u are given opportunity to prove ur innocence. With such a huge population huge numbers of matters are pending in our courts. And with cheap logical ppl filled country this is, ppl eligible to bcm judge are also less. Hence burden on these courts n judges are high. This doesn't mean ppl shud take law on their hands. This is what happns: PEOPLE DIE.
939	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Let this be a warning for all. Let the judiciary, police and lawyers note. The delay in all cases is in the hands of one of these groups. Today the anger is against the accused. Tomorrows mob violence could target other groups in the justice delivery system. There will be hell to pay. Anarchy will reign supreme. Don't let stupid government officials ruin this country by their tardiness.
940	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Dimpur is NOT capital of Nagaland.  Dumbest Newspaper of India.
941	2015-03-07 00:00:00	i read somewhere the accused rapist two brother's are in indian army so if its true then him being an illegal immigrant is a bleak possibility. what if he was framed? every 20/30 mins a rape is reported in india out of which many prove to be false accusations. if this kind of vigilante justice is done on streets imagine how many innocent lives will be lost. i am not against capital punishment for rape and murder but it should be proved first.
942	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Who was the rapist and why is there tension in Assam? Why is the media hiding the details? It's pretty obvious that the rapist was a Muslim from outside state, maybe from Bangladesh. Shame on the Media for making so much noise and in not divulging details.
943	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If law doesn't deliver, people will take law in their own hands. This incident is nothing but impatience of people who feel disappointed by our justice system
944	2015-03-07 00:00:00	WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished dream Yet you made sure she never let her bag her dream Going to a movie with a buddy when the night was still young Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those gods love die so young You gave one so young her inferno and in death bed a tear-scorched throat And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry and rot Matters not  even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-drenched parting words: I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy! Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Still are you so unkind to have deprived her of her life and dream? A question still remains; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Why you didn't I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not And therefore, that question I shall ask you not However, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple innocent dream! Was it too much to ask for?
945	2015-03-07 00:00:00	People taking law in their hands will lead to anarchy.Suppose the charged person is proved innocent.  Would anyone from the crowd come forward to own his unlawful act and present himself for punishment?
946	2015-03-07 00:00:00	While it is scary that mob justice is slowly rising it's ugly head, and can bring in lawlessness into our country, the question is who exactly to blame. The mob ? The Public ??? Now why does a normally gentle and law abiding public resort to such actions ? Obviously because the general, simple minded, citizens/public of India are slowly losing their confidence and belief in our country's judicial system and the courts. Instead of finding fault with the mob - which is just like shooting the messenger - the courts and the judges should immediately do some soul searching and see what to do to restore public's trust and confidence in them. And so should the Government to ensure that they support the courts in this. Sure the courts cannot do something which is against the law, but surely the original mother of all laws - namely the constitution - over rides all other laws and courts should have the sense and intelligence to see how mundane laws brought about by self-serving, rotten politicians, are superimposed with the Constitution.
947	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Indian law for indians not for Bangladeshish. Nagas have done right.
948	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Savage act. There's a chance that they have consensual s*x. How could a man rape a mature girl several times, something fishy in the girls statement. Even if law accuse  him of rape, i consider him much innocent than Nirbhaya rapists if they have consensual s*x and later accused him of rape due to various reason.
949	2015-03-07 00:00:00	when justice fails, ppl rise.. perfect punishment. though claimed to be only accused, 1000s and 1000s have done this. they are not fools and definitely it says this guy has done something evil. barbaric punishment for barbaric act.. nothing wrong..
950	2015-03-07 00:00:00	WHY ALL THIS CIRCUS BY GOVT. SUSPENDING DM, SP ETC???   IF GOVT N JUDICIARY N POLICY DONOT ACT AS THEY SHOULD, PUBLIC IS BOUND TO GET FED UP N TAKE THINGS IN THEIR OWN HANDS....  WAKE UP CALL FOR GOVT.  MODIJEE...PLEASE DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE.

951	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rapist and Nagaland no difference.
952	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The rapist was a muslim from bangla desh These illegal muslims afe a cause of big social tension in those areas The rape of the naga girl only added that extra fite gor social tensions to dpill over The reason is the burdgeoning illegal muslim population
953	2015-03-07 00:00:00	sad that it has again happened. govt calling for report will not solve the problem. govt must discuss with ngo , public activists, all politicians and invite open opinion and come to a conclusion as to to deal with this social crime. govt seriousness needed to take initiative. calling report as usual is a step to aside the real crux of the social crime and social conduct .
954	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The 'Rapist lunch' incident in Dimapur speaks that people are loosing faith in govt and Judiciary
955	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Below some people are sympathetic to rapist and some is defending him just because he is from their relgion of peace . shame on you hypocrite A holes. Its the woman and girls from college and school which led the mob and deliver justice on spot. But this is certainly not the civilized way of impartimg justice.
956	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If this 'Rapist lynch' case is not handled alertly, without any prejudice, a major outbreak of communal violence is likely to happen in Assam and North-East areas of India.
957	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Morons here defending the action seem not to understand English. Article clearly says rape "accused" and not proven yet. What if he was innocent? This should happen to one of those praising such actions in comments. Then they will unsedtand difference between proven and accused. Only if one of their relatives is killed in a such an incident will they understand which courts and proof system is made. Useless bunch of educated fools are always in abundance in comments section here, mostly jobless I guess.
958	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These truckers union are muslim organisation backed Assam and north east afe controlled by muslims now and muslims including bangla desh muslims have free run in this region All bangla muslims have to be removed from These areas  to avoid social destruction The govt cannot and for vote bank cannot do this ---the people in tnese areas will have to do it themselves if they are to survive
959	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You fundamentalist r*scal justifying the murder, need to know a few things that were published in another national level daily newspaper: 1. The accused man was married to a Naga woman. 2. The so-called rape victim was a cousin of the man's wife and used to come to their house frequently. 3. It has been alleged by the man's family that the so-called rape victim had asked for Rs. 2 lakhs from her sister, the man's wife, and had threatened to complain of rape if the money was not given. 4. Medical examination could not confirm sexual assault. Now what is your opinion, you traitor to the country who is trying to ignite communal hatred?
960	2015-03-08 00:00:00	who gave you this information? the girls interview was published on secular NDTV channels and she has a different story to tell
961	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This information is from one of the largest circulated daily newspapers, the ABP. Also, the local TV channels tell the same story. Currently, the media is publishing contradictory reports. Also, there is no foolproof method to determine rape versus wild but consensual union. Even the doctor's report might be false, remember the Shashi Tharoor case? Why should you believe the girl's statement? In any case, my point is not to prove that the man was innocent, but that he deserved a fair trial and not vigilante justice. Just imagine if this had happened to your father or brother on a false allegation.
962	2015-03-09 00:00:00	if we read correctly: medical examination HAS confirmed rape So if he did rape, he has got what he did deserve.
963	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The media is publishing contradictory reports. Also, there is no foolproof method to determine rape versus wild but consensual union. But regardless of the fact whether he was an offender or not, he deserved a fair trial, not lynching by the mob. If you support vigilante justice, then probably half of all our MP's and MLA's should be lynched since they have murder, kidnapping and rape cases pending against them.
964	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Did u see the interview of the rape victim? Do not get influenced by Indian paid media who will defend a Muslim terrorist &amp; rapist..........................will u give the same lecture is ur daughter, sister or wife gets raped??????????????????
965	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Currently, the media is publishing contradictory reports. It is difficult to figure out exactly who is paying the media and why. Also, there is no foolproof method to determine rape versus wild but consensual union. Even the doctor's report might be false, remember the Shashi Tharoor case? Why would you believe the girl's statement? Can't you see that it was a jija-saali affair that went terribly wrong? Why put a religious color on it? In any case, my point is not to prove that the man was innocent, but that he deserved a fair trial and not vigilante justice. Just imagine if this had happened to your father or brother on a false allegation.
966	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Majority Christian mob lynching a Muslim.....  Would have been fun what secular-frauds would have said on this case if that congress sponsored good for nothing "Communal Violence bill" was passed by parliament.
967	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It was a majority muslim raping a minority Naga girl. Do not pull a Gujarat riots style spin here. Do not make a majority Muslim aggressor into a victim . Who started the fire? Your trying to make it a lynching case whole it is a rape case. Stop this gujrat riot style reporting.
968	2015-03-08 00:00:00	For such type of protection the communal violence bill was a right step to hold state govts accountable for mob act by their populations and later modifications included also both majority and minorities under its ambit..
969	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what do you think,,,, a person killed with out reason, and no one should record his agitation too. of course they are muslims and asking for their right, till the society become aware of justice this will continue!!!
970	2015-03-08 00:00:00	they can ask rights in bangaldesh dude
971	2015-03-08 00:00:00	punishment to rapist alright at all, but on blame only punishment is like Ramayen days life, Rama asked Sita for Agni parikhsha for Sita, do u like same???
972	2015-03-07 00:00:00	We can't blame some section for this deplorable incident. Domination of mob and muscle power serve no purpose in s successful democracy. This incident is a challenge to our law and order system and will ruin the reputation of our country. Meanwhile this incident will serve as a warning against the snail's pace of our judiciary.
973	2015-03-07 00:00:00	these incidents are wake up call to the govt.Indian legal system takes 2 years to give punishment to the Nirbhya rapists and the justice still not served if the justice keep on pending then people will have to take the actions.These Bangladeshi people just seeing the religion and not seeing what he did
974	2015-03-07 00:00:00	illegal migrants from BD coming and raping Indian hindu girls... and you expect Hindus to be silent... cant happen boss... good job done by the mob...
975	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagaland wants total freedom you moron.
976	2015-03-07 00:00:00	tell u r beloved modi to close bangladesh border what he is waiting for it was in bjp manifesto that they will stop immigrants from bangladesh
977	2015-03-07 00:00:00	u cant compare every rape accused to nirbhaya rapists the fact is there are rapists in india and there are ladies with not so good character who are free and can go to any extent. do u agree with rape accusation with in live in partners from last two years ? or the concept of rape with a promise of marriage from past three years ? these are clear cases of consensual sex and the lady decided to take revenge once things got sour for some other reason. even in this nagaland case the lady walked into the hotel with the accused to get "raped"
978	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No Logic in your response.
979	2015-03-07 00:00:00	where do u get all this great 'insight'..?? from ur madrassa..???
980	2015-03-07 00:00:00	just read more
981	2015-03-07 00:00:00	India is not a successful democracy.  It is flawed in most levels of govt, Municipal, State and central.  Why is PM Monkey Singh  not behind bars due to his complicity in COALGATE?  Therefore, it is OK for outbursts of people like this.  When will Madrassee people see through the crimes committed by JAyalalitha?  When will Bengalis put their CM to jail?  Successful Democracy my A$$$$$$.
982	2015-03-07 00:00:00	at the same time u cannot NOT blame the certain 'segment' too... cos this 'segment'  is well known for how it treats women, its in their book...their profet did this numerous times to little girls..this 'segment' denies girls education, allows honor killings of women and so on... so dont just blame the mob.. BE FAIR ..!!
983	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All on paper sounds good to talk like this but realize the reality why courts staying the orders and waste too much time and accused supposed to die is burden on society..
984	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Mob did a good job... i support the mob fully....
985	2015-03-07 00:00:00	u r comments smells radical and fanatic
986	2015-03-07 00:00:00	the mob dished out Sharia Law justice to the muzi...!!!!!!!!! cant understand why the muzis are cryin..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
987	2015-03-07 00:00:00	radical fanatic like u always poke religion in all matters people like are the real enemies of india
988	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Stop the cr^p! I'm a hindu and a very proud one too but the cr^p you are talking is unacceptable to any sane person. The accused who was killed was an Indian citizen. His father served in IAF, his brother served in Indian army fought in Kargil and died from injuries sustained during war. I'm sure none of your family members ever served army let alone die for it. Just because he is a muslim you just can't abuse him. It is also now coming out that the naga-girl made a false accusation. Remember Nirvaya, all those brutally violated her and killed her were hindus and i guess it doesn't make you a r^pist too. does it? you can't kill an accused just like that. Its not isis ruled country.
989	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You have lost your mind. Did Hindu's protest the arrest or hanging of Nirbhaya murder accused ? In fact they forced the police to take action against them. In all case Hindus act like that.  You are Psedu secular who to show that you are equal discredit your religion. This is typics of Muslim community that they try to protect even their rape accused. I have experienced it first hand. Go to their community ghetoes and you will realize it.  Truth is not changed by illogical and baseless psedu dialogue of yours. Entire world is tiered of these close minded people. Be it Europe or US so don't try to preach. Let people decide. When they are saying something is there any soul searching Muslim here who would try to find why people have become so anti Muslim.  Everyone cannot be wrong and everytime it cannot be just one person while the community is not to be blamed.  I have walked the lane and seen how they tease Hindu girls in their locality, and you dare tease a muslim girl. I have walked their lane and seen how they keep Outsiders hidden in their ghetoes.  So please don't preach; go and see and experience.
990	2015-03-07 00:00:00	what kind of stupid logic is that? for a muslim accused you blame whole muslim community but when it comes to Nirvaya you use a different logis. wow! The day you start looking for religion of a criminal you are doomed. So u r the type who wants to tease girls, mainly muslim girls? so that's ur moto in life. Yes i'm also angry about muslim/islamic terrorism but that doesn't mean i go and abuse every muslim i see in front of my eyes. or dance on hearing or seeing a dead human being.FYI i'm not secular but hindu and true one. ppl like you are similar to those animal in iraq the isis who are killing ppl for being different, following different religion. You are no HIndu never will be. Hindus are never like that. We are fighting in our way for our way of life for thousands of years and thats why we are still here. The day we change our struggle any copy other's the way to fight we are doomed. You won't understand because you are not true hindu bcos ur mind is corrupted by others.
991	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A person, claiming to be a Hindu, just because he holds some stupid notion that Hindus don't fight is called psedo secular. Pndavas fought their own brothers for their right! I, also, knew that psedo secular would twist my logic of teasing muslim woman. What you don't get, because you are hooked to an idea, is these people consider other community girl as dirt. If a person protects his sister or mother from being teased, he knows that it's not right, therefore, if he is doing that, it means that he is doing it because he feels other community girls are dirt or their brothers are incapable to protect them. This feeling comes because of people like you. I never believe that two humans are the same, but I believe there is something within the community which is breeding so many criminals, terrorists, and wrong doers. If the community is not willing to look within and resolve it then others should not bear it. They need to put a mirror and make them realize it. By brushing aside things, nothing will get resolved. Coming to the case, I have never seen any hindu group taking up case of a rapist with vengeance, and it is a clear sign of the same gheto culture where no one should touch us but we should touch them, feeling. Why should a married man, from whichever community, have a girlfriend and be considered pious. He may be not guilty in court of law, but he definitely is guilty in court of humanity. When he has a wife and child he should stick to them and not romance around. When you do such activity and bear the brunt then the community can file a case but not show solidarity. When you show solidarity it smells of we against them, and then the entire community is to be blamed. Has any single human being come out from that community and said he got what he got into ? Mr. Nanda who was a Naval chielf had fought many wars and served the country. Does that mean he was above law. Who will not say that he was corrupt and guilty of 1) Corruption 2) protecting his grandson in hit and run case. Don't say that because someone is serving Indian Army so they and their relatives are all above law. It's a stupid logic good to fool illeterates. Hope my argument will help you see reality.
992	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Thanks,sri , people like you are still a majority in India , that is the reason why India is still surviving as single, united nation !!!
993	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I very much agree with you sir
994	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Sri s you are a scum bag. My brother serves in the Indian army and don't pull that cr^p on people. Love jihadists is written all over the case. A majority Muslim guy cheats his wife and then tries to take in a vulnerable girl. Rapist deserves it. You are colluding with the aggressor so be careful, your walking a fine line here.
995	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Shut ur potty mouth. a$$O like u are the biggest scumbags on earth. ppl like u are the brothers of isis a&amp;&amp;Os. Type of u both should be erased from the earth to bring back peace on earth.
996	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You SOB, need to know a few things that were published in another national level daily newspaper: 1. The accused man was married to a Naga woman. 2. The so-called rape victim was a cousin of the man's wife and used to come to their house frequently. 3. It has been alleged by the man's family that the so-called rape victim had asked for Rs. 2 lakhs from her sister, the man's wife, and had threatened to complain of rape if the money was not given. 4. Medical examination could not confirm sexual assault. Whether he cheated on his wife or not is a  separate question and has not been settled yet. But even if did so, is the punishment for adultery lynching by the MOB? You traitor to the country, a Hindu agent of the ISIS, need to get the strictest of punishments for posting such inflammatory messages. India cannot prosper until and unless r*scals like you are put in jail for inciting communal hatred.
997	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rapist got what he deserved.. well done...
998	2015-03-07 00:00:00	sound correct but got problems on Ground NOT SOEASY
999	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These... illegal migrants from BD (supported by netas of Assam and WB) coming and raping Indian hindu girls... and you expect Hindus to be silent... cant happen boss... good job done by the mob...
1000	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Chaddi, talk about justice, a man accused of rape which never happend(according to medical report) is being killed by mob and you are justifying this because he is not belongs to your own religion which names it self is given by goras
1001	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Locals uniting against illegals. They should be rejected for all jobs to curb their growth.
1002	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Muzzy got what he deserved... i wish good luck... all the very best for the people who taught this rapist a right lesson...
1003	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I hope u would say the same for we hindus when u come to know that in nirbhaya case all the rape CONVICTS are hindus or even more if you come to know that this man was just an ACCUSED. Learn differentiate between accused and convict.
1004	2015-03-07 00:00:00	.. hahaha  'we hindus'..?? hahhahaa....the true muzi.... . why u cryin..?? the muzi was given sharia law justice right..???
1005	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dont u dare question my religional identity.What I meant is that if u like sharia so much why dont u go to saudi arabia and dig an oil well. For your kind info india is governed by its constitution, not by bhagwat gita or quran or bible. So in the eyes of law lynching is wrong. On the other hand he was just a ACCUSED.even if he was a convict no one can take law into their hands. I hope u know this if u had ever thought of reading the constitution that an accused not guilty until he/she is proven.According national womens commision 75% of the rape cases are false. U think that all women are good and all the devil is inside a man????
1006	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dont try to give solutions sitting in the comfort of your home when you dont know the ground reality and history. Mainland people dont have slightest of knowledge about the region and how these regions have been included in India. The truck unions are not controlled by any specific religious community. Its very difficult to do business in Nagaland and Manipur especially due to seperatist outfits and as the native tribals always have hostile attitude towards outsiders. Most of the business in NE is facilitated by the businessmen in Assam where there are significant number of Marwaris, Gujarathis and also Bengali or Assamese. Its the conflict of power between locals and outsiders. As far as Bengali Muslims are concerned, its quite obvious Assam and parts of NE should have significant Bengali population. This is because the whole region was under the Bengal province during British rule and several districts of Assam are Muslim dominated and was initially under Bangladesh and later on revised to be included in India. The partition happened with lot of modification across several phases. Yes currently the exodus of Muslims are due to Bengali Muslims migrating from Bangladesh and they mainly serve as the major workforce. But the rift will continue as long as the native population becomes accommodating enough and the immigration and dominance is neutralized.
1007	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is not a question of Hindu and Muslim. This is a question of law and justice. The Indian state seems to be powerless when facing mobs( remember the Jats squatting on the tracks and Gurjars blocking the national highway) and powerful individuals. Central jails are built like forts how does a mob enter the central Jail ? How did they enter the jail cell ? How are the people concluding that the person was guilty ? Or for that matter he is BangladeshI? Are not false cases registered ? If you ask any politician in  India he will say all cases against him are false. Do we drag and kill them?? This case is more serious than as rape  as this shows how powerless the Indian state is. If a person can be dragged out a Central Jail paraded naked for an Hour( Distance from jail to clock tower is 5 -8 kms)  and administration fails to act than God help this country. The very fact that the person was in jail shows that the police had acted. Very sad.
1008	2015-03-08 00:00:00	For such type of protection the communal violence bill was a right step to hold state govts accountable for mob act by their populations and later modifications included also both majority and minorities under its ambit.
1009	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Ramesh baliga you are naive. What part of the case makes you think it is not love jihadists? A married man belonging to a majority community that is Islam, seeks out a vulnerable girl then rapes her twice with false promise. He gets caught. Our legal system was working then the mob intervened. But the intervention cannot erase the rape. The trauma the rape victim had to go through cannot be undermined here. Again the similar to Gujarat riots look for the root cause. It was the provocation that is important not the mob reaction. Do research and you will find Assam majority Muslim are involved in love jihad against minority nagas. It is a religious issue and media is depicting the rapist as a victim.
1010	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dear Global, Why don't you use your real name? What is the definition of majority/minority? Brother this is India. If you are a Hindu living in a town with Muslim majority and a muslim locality you are a minority.If you are a Hindu living in a Christian locality again you are a minority. If you are a Bihari living in Mahrashtra you are a minority and if you are a south indian living in a small north indian town you are a minority.just ask a south indian kid studying in a North Indian school in a small town.This definition is applicable to all communities. And a bangla speaking muslim is definitely a minority in Nagaland. Nagaland is christian and Nagas are as such distinct ethnic people. Get some education brother.
1011	2015-03-08 00:00:00	When a Naga is hurt in any other part of India due to this incident then will you call Naga minority. Your logic erroe is in the fact that you have forgotten our fundamental right-freedom to momove anywhere in India. Nagasawa live in Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore and other parts of India. So a local area sampling for majority/minority calculations is as outdated nehruvian politics. As Indian government protected Mumbai Muslims after Mumbai massacre by putting out a lie, no Indian Muslim involved in the massacre, similar excercise should have been done to protect nagas. Instead they chose to allow media to do a gujrat style bogus reporting. Rajdeep style bogus reporting that could end up nCosting many more lives.&lt;br/&gt;What's in the name brother it's the idea. By the way I am the janitor of India, I clean everybodies soils.
1012	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Of course a Naga person outside Nagaland is minority. But that does not take away the right to move anywhere in India. In fact a law has to be passed where the definition of minority has to be amended and anybody living outside his state in non cosmopolitan area has to be protected. This is more applicable to NE people who look different and are many times assaulted. This incident happened in Nagaland and videos were all over the place how could have anybody concealed the fact that it was the Nagas who assaulted the accused. Only thing that could have been concealed was the religion of the dead man. If you want to call yourself a janitor thats your problem
1013	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Muslim majority man has committed a crime against a minority girl. But media is making him the victim and do you care to know why?
1014	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas have the power to enter Tihar Jail  and handle the Nirbhaya Rapists!
1015	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagaland incident was not a rape  but it was misuse of law by bloody women. CCTV camara shows this lady and man enter into hotel and later coming out together. if he rape her how she come out with him. Also she was raped many times as per her statement in the police. If he rape her before why the hell she go with him into hotel. This is gross misuse of law by todays empowered women and she should be paraded naked and later lynched so that other women not miuse the law. Also the police should be punished and judge who throw him into jail without any evidence should be kill by pouring petrol on him.  Why should man always suffer ? Bloody radical feminist want maximum number of man behind the bar and show the statistics of crime again women very high so that they can get various funds from all over the world for women protection and their life in luxuary. In 2013-14 budget Union Govt has allocated  98000 crores for women welfare and any one can show even one women get any amount? Nooooooooooooo all money is gone to feminists and women groups and nothing for our mothers and sisters.
1016	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Kevin you are right. This is love jihad written all over it. This man was married and still raped a vulnerable women. What do you call it.
1017	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is proved that they murdered an innocent. Now it is the turn of Police General and Home Minister. Without doubt they should be hanged! I understand the Truth. But these facts will not heard by the masses..
1018	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I am not passing any comment about this particular incident but it is a fact that women now a days are taking lot of undue advantage of various laws in their favour. If one goes through dowry cases, torture by in-laws or husband, molestation etc.,you will find most of them tobe fabricated and out number the actual ones. It is so sad that women are misusing the laws made to safeguard them.
1019	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It was not feminism, it was racial. Deadly mix of Christianity, tribal culture and failure to achieve independence that worked together.
1020	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Keep dreaming. Apne ghar mein billi bhi sher hota hai. There are reports and CCTv footages that the so called accused and victim entered a hotel together. She got 5000/- and when she demanded more and was refused, she filed the rape case
1021	2015-03-08 00:00:00	She tried to black mail him. Naga  People did a big mistake.  They can apologize by attacking  Tihar jail and murdering the Mukesh singh and gang!
1022	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Mr.Ramesh Baliga, unfortunately we Indian jump upon religion, caste, creed , North, South,very soon and start passing comments on someone without realizing that a criminal is just a criminal his caste or creed has to do nothing with his crime.
1023	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You do not know the situation in Nagaland and some other parts of Next it may be turn of a HIndu or a group of Bihari or Bengali or Marwari.
1024	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So now society has sympathisers for rapist and criminals. why truckers organization backing a rapist
1025	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Because he was Bangladesi Otherwise no body would have cared .
1026	2015-03-07 00:00:00	By looking at the trucker's act, you are ( knowingly) overlooking the main crime of lynching somebody. Are you in favor of such inhuman act? Why we need police and judiciary if this is what you believe in! And who are these people who lynched somebody and what right did they have to do that?
1027	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This was done asper shariya law
1028	2015-03-08 00:00:00	But the victim was an innocent.
1029	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Yes in India, Sharihat law exists! And the Sangh Parivar support it.
1030	2015-03-08 00:00:00	FATIMA GREAT ! At Least for 4 marriages Iam ready to support Sharia law
1031	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You can kill and eat COW, but not FISH! Matsya Avatar was the first Avatar of Lord Vishnu, among the Dashavatara (Dasavatara) or the ten principal Avatars of Mahavishnu.
1032	2015-03-07 00:00:00	They want to get marry with four women selectively quoting sharia
1033	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ME too
1034	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Are you cracking a joke ? So many rapes are not committed if police is effective. So many big time criminals don't become politicians if police is effective. Please don't crack jokes
1035	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Chup be Katuye..
1036	2015-03-07 00:00:00	haa suar
1037	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Member of MohaMAD's pig army commenting...Haha.
1038	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You can kill and eat COW, but not FISH! Matsya Avatar was the first Avatar of Lord Vishnu, among the Dashavatara (Dasavatara) or the ten principal Avatars of Mahavishnu. Matsya means â  fishâ   in Sanskrit and Matsya Avatar is the incarnation taken by Lord Vishnu in the form of Fish.
1039	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Kapil Sir, so you are saying that this rapist can given interview to BBC in the coming months
1040	2015-03-07 00:00:00	he was an accused. we do not know if he really was a rapist. what if he was an innocent person?
1041	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Reliable source says, they are couples, living together, since long. But People are Jealous.
1042	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So, apparently now while vehemently trying to defend the rapist, the accused has become the hero.Someone saying the accused family served in the indian army.lol.While some others are saying that the girl was in a live in relationship with the accused.Again someone said that the girls is a prostitute and then again some others are saying the the girl is a cousin of the accused wife.Some people are trying so much to defend the rapist just because he is a muslim.Wow, this is called the secular india.
1043	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Accused was an INNOCENT. He never raped the girl. Naga people killed an innocent and they should be punished.
1044	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Fatima ! your source is reliable and the girls testimony is not wow
1045	2015-03-07 00:00:00	the person who is lynched and killed is from barak velly assam ,was a son of a late indian airforce officer,two of his brothers are in indian army,as shown in local news channels the man was in some type of relationship with the girl,no rape was proved in medical examination,it may not be a case of rape,justice without trial is madness. Read Ibn. Medical examination not saying that she is sexually assaulted
1046	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So, apparently now while vehemently trying to defend the rapist, the accused has become the hero.Someone saying the accused family served in the indian army.lol.While some others are saying that the girl was in a live in relationship with the accused.Again someone said that the girls is a prostitute and then again some others are saying the the girl is a cousin of the accused wife.Some people are trying so much to defend the rapist just because he is a muslim.Wow, this is secular india.
1047	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nice. One more interview to expose the culture of India!  Great!
1048	2015-03-07 00:00:00	where was police when Delhi gang rape victim was being attacked on Delhi road for 2 hours in bus. Fact is Police is almost useless in crime prevention.
1049	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You mean to say he must be kept alive at government expances
1050	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So you know he had raped. Good register your evidence in the police station.
1051	2015-03-07 00:00:00	they are backing a fellow follower of mohammad
1052	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Mr.Dee kay, why are you so communal minded? Where is the question of backing anyone? You mean to say that to kill some accused (Not proved guilty) is right just because he is a follower of Mohammad? Tomorrow if Mukesh (rapist of Nirbhaya) is killed like this and someone agrees and says rightly done because he is a hindu, will you agree?
1053	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So, apparently now while vehemently trying to defend the rapist, the accused has become the hero.Someone saying the accused family served in the indian army.lol.While some others are saying that the girl was in a live in relationship with the accused.Again someone said that the girls is a prostitute and then again some others are saying the the girl is a cousin of the accused wife.Some people are trying so much to defend the rapist just because he is a muslim.Wow, this is called the secular india.Meanwhile just read a news report informing that the medical reports confirmed that the girl has been raped.But i do agree that the accused should be tried according to the law and if he is proved to be guilty then he should be punished according to the law.
1054	2015-03-07 00:00:00	really u see things only in black and white suppose tomorrow u r falsely accused would u want to have a chance to defend u r self or hand ursefl to mob
1055	2015-03-07 00:00:00	mob violence is not the solution. it is nothing short of taliban style
1056	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This will make Government and courts to wake up
1057	2015-03-07 00:00:00	when people loose faith in institution of justice, this what happen. Delhi Rape culprits are still giving obnoxious interviews from inside the jail. When will they get punishment for their crimes.
1058	2015-03-07 00:00:00	How did you conclude that he was a rapist?
1059	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Girl has told on T V
1060	2015-03-07 00:00:00	simple reason- he was muzzie boy and muzzie think it was their great brother- send this bangla muzzie out of country to make it safe for all religions but worthless congress with come to save in name of secularism
1061	2015-03-07 00:00:00	We all know why there is sympathy, don't we?
1062	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Society has no sympathisers for rapist so also no symppathisers for the mob violence. In the present case it appears the police is doubtful about the rape by the accused.
1063	2015-03-07 00:00:00	truckers protesting in favor or rapist? odd -

1065	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So what if the trail takes 20odd years and costs thousands on food, clothing, shelter and security :-)
1066	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I hope somebody lodges an FIR against you and your fellow Bengalis lynch you. Bengalis are good at forming mobs. Remember Mamata Di storming the police station.
1067	2015-03-07 00:00:00	HA ha... justifications may come.He was an old hand and wanted to marry her. Be in Nagaland and do this and sure  better advised have an insurance before indulging in this behaviour. Yes stay there and then you will understand.Being in the Air Force or Army doesn't give him a licence to do whatever he wants to !!
1068	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So what if the trail takes 20 odd
1069	2015-03-07 00:00:00	That means ifa is recruiting Bangladeshis now ..

1073	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dear Bob, I do not know whether the accused was a rapist or not? I only know for sure- 1. that he was not given a fair trial. 2.I definitely know that the Indian state failed to discharge its duties. 3. I definitely know that the administration connived to open the gates of central jail and allowed the mob to enter. 4. I definitely know that the persons who lynched and the police who connived who are on camera and are guilty.
1074	2015-03-07 00:00:00	* WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished dream Yet you made sure she never let her bag her dream Going to a movie with a buddy when the night was still young Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those gods love die so young You gave one so young her inferno and in death bed a tear-scorched throat And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry and rot Matters not  even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-drenched parting words: I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy! Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Still are you so unkind to have deprived her of her life and dream? A question still remains; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Why you didn't I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not And therefore, that question I shall ask you not However, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple innocent dream! Was it too much to ask for?

Please truck driver association stop showing your sympathy towards the rapist.When people loose their faith in judiciary system this happens. I can assure you one thing that in near future nobody will dare to touch a girl in nagaland.
1085	2015-03-07 00:00:00	how can  you be so sure he is a rapist? he was an accused. today anyone can be accused for anything. what data you have to be so sure he is a rapist.? whatever the case, the people from the mob are pure cold blooded murderers.

1094	2015-03-07 00:00:00	RSS, VHP, Hindu Mahasabha Mobs have been ruling India through Mob Terrorism since independence, this is no different. He was lynched because he was a Muslims, not because he was charged with Rape. This is the direct result of Modi and BJP campaign to demonize Muslims in the Country.
1095	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nagaland is christian get yourself properly educated and then comment.
1096	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Modi deserted his wife. RSS men will not marry. Then what they can do? R A P E
1097	2015-03-07 00:00:00	There we go again, media started Gujarat style biased reporting. Now perhaps public money may be used to pay victims family for probable love jihadists against a minority Naga girl. This rapist not only was cheating on his wife but destroy ed a girls life and now media is trying to him the victim. Bogus media should be stopped.
1098	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Now Bangladeshis have become this size to demand justice and ignore what that guy did??? Vote bank politics allowing all anti nationals to grow like weed
1099	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The rapist is a Muslim. Look at the speed with which Amnesty and agencies and assoc's spring in his favor. I am sure amnesty or organisations would have even cared if he was not a Muslim. I remember a lynching in nagpur court premises some years ago by naxalite organisations, supposedly, of a Hindu goon for similar charges of rape. I also remember that every organisation worth its salt hailed that mob lynching and gave advice to law enforcing agencies and criticised police and justice departments for delay and miscarriage of justice.
1100	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These rapists do not care about the women they attack, they do not appreciate beauty, intelligence, mutual understanding, companionship or any of the other amazing aspects of women. They only feel when they are taking or doing something to someone else. The issue is that their emotions are for the most part switched off! Or only relative to their appetites.

1104	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is a grave situation for not only Nagaland but all states along bangladesh border. Continous influx of bangladeshis in these states, is changing their demographic and ethnic character. Bangladeshis are occupying their land , property , jobs and shameless state governments are busy suppliying them adhar cards , ration cards and even passports , in their lust for vote bank !!! If this influx of bangladeshis is not checked, all eastern Indian states will soon burn like Burma !!!
1105	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You are absolutely right, the demographics of West Bengal and Assam are changing fast. The Muslim population is fast increasing, more so at an alarming rate, fundamentalism has spread, and the most shocking part that this is aided and abetted by the respective state govts. If this is not checked now, in future these people would demand their own state. That is what Pakistan and other outside powers with vested interests are trying to do here.
1106	2015-03-08 00:00:00	In delhi  haryana bihar &amp; UP people should do this to rapists .
1107	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All those who are justifying the murder, need to know a few things that were published in another national level daily newspaper: 1. The accused man was married to a Naga woman. 2. The so-called rape victim was a cousin of the man's wife and used to come to their house frequently. 3. It has been alleged by the man's family that the so-called rape victim had asked for Rs. 2 lakhs from her sister, the man's wife, and had threatened to complain of rape if the money was not given. 4. Medical examination could not confirm sexual assault. Now what is your opinion?
1108	2015-03-08 00:00:00	from which source you get this piece of information, this is why rape will never stop in India,
1109	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Which source? From ABP, which is one of the largest circulated dailies in India. Also, many of the local TV channels have broadcasted this over and over again. Even the CM of Assam, Gogoi, has confirmed that there was no rape and the man was framed. Mr. North-easterner, your people are already alienated enough, though the fault is not entirely yours. Now my advice: do not alienate yourself further from mainstream India by indulging in mindless violence against people who are not of north-east origin. The repercussions could well spell doom for you and your brothers.
1110	2015-03-07 00:00:00	these nagas did this wrong, now they will face collateral damage in whole country.. why that rss d og arnab goswami not barking now? this is what happens in achhe din.. some people just kill an innocent indian citizen. this is wrong I condemn naga's and their actions.
1111	2015-03-07 00:00:00	There is no use of protesting for a bad cause! The rapist has to suffer the consequence of his savage act! Government &amp; judicial decrees &amp; punishments take years after the crime!What will these protesters do if one of their children were to be abused like this??Our judicial system should change &amp; summary punishment should be given to the perpetrator! If juveniles are involved , they are released &amp; sent to juvenile homes! Can a juvenile Body &amp; a rapist mind go unpunished??
1112	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Put each of these bangla truckers behind bars!!!how dare they support this.???your religion teaches u this????
1113	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is bound to happen when justice is delayed
1114	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All of sudden muslims are showing sympathy to thr rapist jist beacuse his name is Sayed Farid Khan. Even a muslim guy commenting here "He is shaheed". WTF!! Till the time his name was not published, everyone (including Muslims) were like "Acha hua jo bhi hua". Now its taking communal turn. I m aksing one question. While raping did Farid forget all the teachings of Islam. Where was his 'true muslim' wala attitude. Where was his values of Namaaz? Crime n criminal have no religion. I would not say this lyniching and all are good but he deserved that.
1115	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Why is so much hue and cry for this one happened in Nagaland ? There are so many incidents like this in the country but no such hue and cry was happened ? The infamous Jehanabad jail break incident was happened , several people were killed and seFeral dozens were freed by the attackers but no such hue and cry , why ? No body is talking about that Bangladeshi who illegally come in India and become a business man and in a raze he raped a Naga lady ? More justice required by that lady than the lynched foreigner .
1116	2015-03-07 00:00:00	When the girl was raped no officials were dismissed from duty for not being able to save her, but when the crowd punished the rapist,  officers were suspended, truckers do protest... What is going on in this country?

Your feigned or willful ignorance, about Islam, is no longer an excuse. I hold you personally accountable. I am offended by you. I cannot and will not tolerate a person, who follows an ideology, which teaches the inferiority of women, the killing and hatred of Jews, the execution of hom- os- ex uals, the silencing of free speech, forced amputations, the stoning of ra -pe victims, gen it al mu tilation, and the violent overthrow of all non-Islamic governments and civilizations.

1123	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It is very important to completely eliminate Islam from India and export all its followers. They must either revert back to their roots or leave this country for Pakshitan which was created for them.
1124	2015-03-07 00:00:00	look at the comment below and all the the sudden sicular swines  are talking about human rights , and a flood of comments, but let a news regarding ISIS selling woman and raping the enslaving them in the name of islam , all these hypocrite A holes swine will hide in rats holes, and there will be no comment against them , but as now a rapist swine had been killed all are hauling victim and human rights. A HOLES.
1125	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Don't blame him he is shaheed the rape was not. proven
1126	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Not surprised to hear this statement from you....After all your Quran allows rape. Your Quran.........1. Quran allows rape: Quran (33:50) - O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful ..............2. Quran recommends forced conversions: Quran (8:39) - “And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism: i.e. worshipping others besides Allah) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah Alone [in the whole of the world ] ...............3. Quran recommends beating women: Quran (4:34) - Men are overseers over women, by reason of that wherewith Allah hath made one of them excel over another, and by reason of that which they expend of their substance. Wherefore righteous women are obedient, and are watchers in husbands absence by the aid and protection of Allah. And those wives whose refractoriness ye fear, exhort them, and avoid them in beds, and beat them; but if they obey you, seek not a way against them; verily Allah is ever Lofty, Grand

1129	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Muslim  rape or get involved with non muslim women as seen from news .Have you read any news where a muslim was caught for similar offence against muslim women  .? Is it because they consider these  non muslims as fair game ? Or they think that community of these girls will not react and they will get away  with it ? Or is it because they consider their women under wraps and veils not risque or interesting ? Are muslims frustrated with muslim women ? Even in bollywood muslim actors marry fall for non muslim women  May be otis because of sexual  frustration due to veiled muslim women
1130	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The incident reflects total loss of faith in the Indian judiciary. Taking law into own hands can be most counter productive.
1131	2015-03-07 00:00:00	what the international human rights comm is saying about the nagaland lynching incident is only standard comment but in India it will definitely take communal turn as the details are pouring in and we are going to see a whole community behind a repist to avenge the age old anemity
1132	2015-03-07 00:00:00	How do you know he was a rapist ? A mere FIR is not a proof of crime. Everyday hundreds of FIR are registered so we have to just pronounce punishments and we can do away with the courts.
1133	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No charity for this rapist muzzie immigrant bangladeshi...
1134	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Kill these protesting sickulars.  Naga mob did the right thing.  Popat mohamad too should by lynched !
1135	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Totally
1136	2015-03-07 00:00:00	the people in nagaland have vented their anger against the rapist because of our justice system which is as slow as a snail and because of political interference , they should not have killed him but cut his body part and left him to die
1137	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Killing this rapist is perfact judgement. This is the best way of judgement in india. Other states should learn from nagaland.
1138	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I cannot understand how anyone can protest in favor of rapists. The mob was right in lynching the rapist, otherwise, it  would have another case where the accused woud be set free after years of judicial picnic and the only persons who suffer are the raped individual and her family. If teh trucker's problem is toll collection by Govt and separtely by militants, it is a totally separate issue which needs to be addressed by the Govt.
1139	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Administration in Dimapur should have been more strict  in handling the situation. The trucker who did the crime should have got strict punishment, but not like this. We have law, govt etc... But I am stunned to read that members of his organization were protesting. Suddenly from nowhere Human rights people got awake. Now Arundhati Ghosh, Shobha Dey and Medha Patkar will protest killing of trucker. Patkar may sit for 'dharna' also, Mrs Dey will declare 'she is ready to go to jail for 5yrs. for human rights of the criminal'.. good
1140	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These protesters are the prospective or concealed rapists...
1141	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Instead of protesting against killing truckers should have protested against illegal Bangladeshi muslims who are creating law and order problem in entire north east including Nagaland and Assam.The centre and states should immediately identify the illegal Bangladeshi muslims and arrest them and strip their citizenship and keep them in guarded camps like Myammar did . That is the only solution.
1142	2015-03-07 00:00:00	They themselves are illegal Bangladesi
1143	2015-03-09 00:00:00	please don't bring any communal hatred. Better to see this incident independently.
1144	2015-03-09 00:00:00	which means that all these truckers are muslims and if they are in such majority, probably are bangladeshi immigrants.. they should be immediately transported back to bangladesh...see their temerity staying in india, and opposing the killing of a rapist.. this is what is going to be the state of india in a few years from now.  (by the way i am not saying that all rapists should be killed.. that was the demand of the scream mob that jumped out after jaya bachhan's drama in parliament.. it seems for them raping is a bigger crime than terrorism.. where were all these people by the way during terrorist attacks and media was singing praises of the resilience of the people to go about their duties like nothing has happened)
1145	2015-03-09 00:00:00	providing equal justice is always important to everyone as it makes sure the correct judgement is provided and not on the basis of false allegations or reports. the main points and facts need to be considered before doing any act by the court in nagaland.
1146	2015-03-09 00:00:00	there needs to be a law where the justice is delivered accordingly and not according to a group of persons or an organization. this will make the govt. body to make wrong decisions or make decisions in the favour of the organization who have protested.

1149	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This issue should not become a religious or Assam v/s Nagaland.  The lynching is wrong and if everybody starts taking law into their hand anarchy will prevail everywhere. People should not talk about the religion of a rapist because rapist are beasts and don't have affiliation to any religion. You can understand the mind set of these people from the interview given by Mukesh on Nirbhaya rape.

What will the Judge punish the false complainant ???? - NO  In every civilized society, this complaint would not be termed rape - but in India, thanks to 60 years of Congress rule, such complaints are treated as rape !!!!!!  May the money mongering complainant rot in hell - for Rs 2 lakhs, she got the fellow killed !  Also its not possible that mob breaks out just 1 man from prison - its rubbish - was he the only alleged rapist in the whole prison ?????

Tomorrow even you can be at the receiving end of a mob, if stranded in a hostile environment. The mob pre-judged the matter and its not just a casualty but  global embarassment now. By the way, this Muslim man's - not sure if he was guilty or not, as I won't pre-judge, unlike you, but wasn't a Bangladeshi. His entire family served in the Indian army with one brother martyred in Kargil. Father was in the air force.

You made her mumble her sorrow-drenched parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!"

But let us all now Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the mega thugs, super criminals and ultra anarchists Behind all these comparatively merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life more and more difficult in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and sick human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like you and me and our kith and kin? What a travesty of justice and fair play That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, plundered and pilfered only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn As a direct result! Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their direct creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Thousands of truly qualified others Have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India and Indians possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history!

It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives as a nation Despite all the anti-India and anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve them of their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to each and every Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizen? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!

1169	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what a twist, rapist blame girl for being rape in the Delhi rape case, now the rape victim is blamed for being raped in Nagaland. Medical report changes overnight, Are we Indians Justifying rape? Is it because Justice was delivered by minorities? From rape case to truckers taxation issue, opportunist everywhere ## Sad India// Women has no place in Indian society.
1170	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Truckers in Assam on Saturday stopped plying their vehicles from here to Dimapur and other parts of Nagaland in protest against the lynching of a rape accused in Nagaland's commercial hub Dimapur on Thursday.  At least 17 truckers
1171	2015-03-08 00:00:00	An innocent killed by mob. Shame to Nagaland Police and Government.
1172	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Naga People can apologize for this heinous murder by attacking Tihar jail and murdering the Mukesh singh and gang!
1173	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Taking law in one's own hand is bad for the society. Here there are few trying to make it religious matter,whatever the religion is crime is a crime and it must be brought to justice.All humans are equal let it be Muslims or Hindu or Christian or Jew.Man should abolish all religion and live for human beings and their well being.
1174	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hate towards muslim who rape local can't be  tolerated by local any more.
1175	2015-03-08 00:00:00	That Girl never raped. The victim was INNOVENT. Naga  people should apologize.
1176	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You trust a muslim and specially convert I don't . When a convert is not loyal to his  own roots  or nation that person is lier and can't be trusted one who bows to your nation's enemy many times a day.
1177	2015-03-09 00:00:00	TRUTH is truth. You can't change it.
1178	2015-03-08 00:00:00	this is what happens when cops n judges dont do their jobs correctly..
1179	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Come on people..the mob killed a criminal not a god messenger. We may call it Wake up call, or challenge to the system.
1180	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Clever, how do you know that the person killed was a criminal? Was he convicted by a court of law?  Just because the girl complained of rape you conclude he was a criminal? Tomorrow if a scheming woman alleges rape against you, should you be paraded naked and killed by a mob even before the matter is decided in court? Do you know the whole story behind this incident? Do you know that the girl was the sister-in-law of the killed man, was in some kind of consensual relationship with him and was trying to blackmail him?People like you are no different from the Taliban or the ISIS and should be severely punished for encouraging people to break the law.
1181	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Do you know that the men has a pending rape case walking free on bail, if he was left alive he would be granted bail and again the raping spree will continue, hats off ..India
1182	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is proved that he was innocent. The girl was black mailing him for money. She is absconding.
1183	2015-03-08 00:00:00	we strongly condemn this barbaric  act of mob delivering justice for an act that is allegedly to have been committed. Media trial is a serious hazard to the principles of natural justice.
1184	2015-03-07 00:00:00	We live in a civilised society.we are bound by law.We are not barbarians.Although, the crime he committed was terrible.and horrid,by behaving in a savage manner with the prisioner,we too become a savage like him.
1185	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rampant cases of rape and also of people takeing the law in their hand is disgusting and deplorable. We need to make oyr criminal justice system effective and robust. For now the gov. Shoubring those involved in lynching to justice  but even bigger task is to set up a proper system to investigate cases of rape as the attitude of law enforcers towards the rape victim is  negative same with the society in general
1186	2015-03-07 00:00:00	"The killing of Syed Farid Khan, a Dimapur based businessman from Assam, is an inhuman act". My question is raping a lady is not an "inhuman act"? Why there is no protest by the truckers? "This is a serious lapse in the criminal justice system"; - which one? - killing a rapist or raping a lady?
1187	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You perverted blood* feminist, you people are indirectly responsible for this lynching of a probably innocent man. You need to know a few things that were published in another national level daily newspaper: 1. The accused man was married to a Naga woman. 2. The so-called rape victim was a cousin of the man's wife, was their next door neighbor, was in some sort of relationship with the man and used to come to their house frequently. 3. It has been alleged by the man's family that the so-called rape victim had asked for Rs. 2 lakhs from her sister,  the man's wife, which was probably blackmail, and had threatened to complain of rape if the money was not given. 4. Medical examination could not confirm sexual assault. Now what is your opinion?

This incident clearly shows that the people are losing faith in the judiciary. What happened is not right.. but the guy, if he is guilty, got exactly what he deserved. Would love to see the Nirbhaya killers meet with the same fate.
1203	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is a planned way to get out non Naga businessman from Dimapur and Nagaland. Local news Channel of Assam reveals CC Tv footage of the girl with the man. Medical examination does not reveal any rape or torture.

There are 7000 cases of Rape and Human Rights abuses pending in Courts of north east and they have to pick a lone Muslim Rape accused and lynch him. This definitely smacks of some political involvement and the BJP at center has some answering to do !!
1205	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rape is a grievous crime. Death does not mean the end of investigation into the rape incident. It is a heinous crime committed by a illegal immigrant. His antecedents should be checked. It should be investigated, how this person sneaked into India. The dead person's semen should be matched with that found on the woman's clothes and internal parts. It should also be investigated as to how he created fake documents to become a resident of Assam. Once the investigation is over, the next case, of public lynching should also be thoroughly investigated.

1219	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These protestors are blaming the mob in guise of criminal justice system prevailing. Question is where is the justice system. Time lapsed delayed justice is simply justice denied is what they forget. What happened to Nirbhaya rapist? He became a celebrity worldwide and a state guest for more than three years. Is this justice. Today it is Nagaland, tomorrow it would be whole of India where people would be forced to do mob instant justice because our administration, government and police have failed the common man. Thumbs up for the brave people of Nagaland.

"We appeal for peace, for violent reactions on both sides of the border would take us to a point of no return," he said.  Earlier, the MCD issued a joint appeal with the Naga Hoho - the traditional apex body of Naga tribes - for maintaining peace and tranquillity.  The two organisations reminded people how restraint after the rape of a Naga woman by five alleged Bangladeshis in February 2012 had helped in maintaining harmony. "In that case, we demanded capital punishment for the rapists, besides asking the local authorities to undertake a registration drive of all genuine Muslim residents in Dimapur to check heinous crimes often committed by immigrant Muslims," an MCD spokesperson said. " ..... this type of news if is in rest of the media, it wold stop whipping up communal passion... which no one can afford to have... the repurcussions are not worth it... even for as heinous a case as this one...
1230	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The victim of rape has been put away in a corner and all people are now concentrating on the lynching. Mob justice means failure of all civil administration. The rapists deserve severe punishment but as per the law in our Couuntry. What if it is found later that the person killed was not the culprit? and even if he is death by beating by a mob cannot be justified by civil society. the victim of rape has been put away in a corner and all people are now concentrating on the lynching.
1231	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I am proud of the Nagas and I hope this incidents will make such rapist think twice before looking at a Naga woman.  Keep it up and don't allow politicians to play with your womans. Rest of India is with you.  Shame ont he truckers from Assam, whoever they are. WE would not like them anywhere in India. If they do any such thing in any part of india they would be treated the same. So be where you think you have support.
1232	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I think this z paid news just for trp n escalate tension by making a mountain out of mole
1233	2015-03-07 00:00:00	assamese r more worried about illegal bangladeshi muslim immigrants rather than indians in nagaland
1234	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Accused is culprit till the truth is known. It is the duty of the State to provide physical security to the people in jail. Law clearly provides who will punish a culprit and how. If mobs were to decide this, the police and the government are not needed!
1235	2015-03-07 00:00:00	insence bangladesi supporters
1236	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rapists must be killed at a public square, in open view of general public so that all potential future offenders feel the scare of what awaits them should they decide to violate the modesty of any women or child!  There can be no other solution to this social scourge wherein the criminals have no fear of law &amp; mostly get away from being punished in the due process of law enforcement.  Kill them, maim them &amp; burn them with speed &amp; alacrity! A few innocents (accused of rape) even if killed shall be of no consequence in the bigger picture of spreading the scare across the potential rapists in the Indian society.
1237	2015-03-07 00:00:00	time to review judicial and police system, speedy justice without prejudice is required. Protest in favour of rapist is condemnable as is this brutual lynching
1238	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Lynching in this modern age is  highly condemnable perpetrators should be brought to books/prosecuted&amp;awarded exemplary punishment.
1239	2015-03-07 00:00:00	lol , illegal muslim bangladeshi migrant is now a businessman ..... it happens only in india , incredible india full of stupid f0ks supporting bangladeshis
1240	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Wat the businessman did also isn't rite.. one wrong can't justify another wrong
1241	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Beat up the nagas in Assam.simple.then the animals of north east will die beating each other
1242	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I am not at all worried about India's image; I am only concerned about quick justice, even if the so-called image takes a beating. Few day back a billionaire and his brother were given to the firing squad by China; the people responsible for the riots in Urungchi province in China have been executed by law. Did it lower the image of China?  Did America and Britain stop business with China because of that? China does not care about what the International Human Rights organisation and also America and Europe say. Leslee Udwin, now make a film that India is strong enough to deal with the those who rape; make a film to show that those who rape get good punishment in India; make a film that, India is no more helpless in the hands of the courts and lawyers and politicians. ha ha ha
1243	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Do u guys know how many rape victims we have in Nagaland, that too by illegal immigrants. Don't comment or judge by just one incident. I agree what had happened shouldn't have happened. And although  I,  a konyak Naga, totally condemned such act, n the instigators should b punished. The case here is due to the failure of the state machineries, as some of u have rightly pointed out. At the same time, I request the media's not to report hearsay, rather they should investigate, if possible, n report the fact, instead of aggravating the situation. His past account should also b taken into consideration.
1244	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If the person was innocent all the people who touched him should be charged with murder.
1245	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is not a good news\. The seven sisters state should actually live like seven sisters.
1246	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rapists are there in every community. Don't jump on religion you communal minded shito. Mukesh who raped and killed Nirbhaya is your father or what. Why don't you go and kill him too.
1247	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Assam was killing Muslims, a few days ago, was'nt it? I am not sure that Assam is actually affected at all.
1248	2015-03-07 00:00:00	In usa it takes average of 9.8 years to execute a death row prisoner. This is for the mob of India with no sense.  Its about the state's willingness to risk executing innocent people. As of now, there are 138 known cases where someone wrongly convicted was sentenced to death.;  The average time they served before being taken off death row was 9.8 years.  Accelerating the process will guarantee the execution of innocent people.
1249	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Why protests now.Rape victim got the justice and rapist was lynched,this is the real justice done by the public.Now these truckers who are protesting against the killing of rapist must be crushed by the state govt.
1250	2015-03-07 00:00:00	In usa he average time they served before being taken off death row is  9.8 years.
1251	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Indian legal system should be blamed for this ....The culprits should be punished within a reasonable time...
1252	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Why protests now.Rape victim got the justice and rapists was lynched,this is the real justice done by the public.Now these truckers who are protesting against the killing of rapists must be crushed by the state govt.
1253	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Rape or not rape but public lynching is absolutely wrong. It shows how weak the law is. This is India.
1254	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Can a Son or Brother of IAF, Army or Navy be pardoned if he is a Rapist?
1255	2015-03-07 00:00:00	People with mob mentality are cheering the lynching. It can lead to disintegration of the country when people take law into their hands.
1256	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Friends of India. first of all I want say that the incident that happened was not right. points are  1.. guy was from assam 2. his brothers are working in Indian Army 3 one of his brother died in Kargil 4 his father was there in indian airforce 5 there is a video proof that girl was there with that guy in the hotel that night and she never looked that she was raped. 6 She is not a minor 7 Medical report say that she was not raped 8 Its only allegation made,  NOW FRIENDS PLEASE PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NOW A DAYS THERE IS A SECTION OF WOMAN THOSE WHO ARE MISUSING THIS POWER FULL LAW. AND MAKING IT CONTROVERSY. i STAND WITH NIRVAYA, AS IT WAS RIGHT. THOSE RAPIST SHOULD BE HANG. BUT THIS CASE IT WAS MISHANDLED. IN FUTURE ANY ONE OF US CAN BE VICTIM BY THIS SECTION OF WOMEN BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. THEN NOBODY WILL COME AND SAFE YOU AS THEY WILL ALSO POST LIKE U WITHOUT KNOWING THE TRUTH......  THANKS FRIENDS
1257	2015-03-07 00:00:00	unable to understand , what is being supported...
1258	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Whether the person was a mulim a hindu or a christian is not the point. The fellow had committed a crime , he had raped a women. What the crowd did was absolutely correct. Till our judicial system gives exemplary punishment to these rapists, the public will react in this way and there is nothing wrong in this. We cannot allow case like Nirbhaya keep on happening. I request the Assam govt to cancel the licence of all the Truck Association members immediately.
1259	2015-03-07 00:00:00	please investigate further it seems that it was not at all a rape but a case of revenge and black mail for money...police should honestly investigate and produce the report
1260	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Mob is a mob, in Nagaland or London.  What we will not see in london is a crippled security apparatus like nagaland (and elsewhere in India). So, criminals can take this as a case study: it takes a mob of about five thousand to jailbreak. Easy number to muster for many a musclemen in UP and Bihar. Nothing would have happened, no jailbreak, no lynchig, nothing if the security system was well oiled. You cant go aroung blaming public for everythig. If it were not for the dark side of human nature we'd never hve required policing in the first place. And now that we do, please provide us adequtely.
1261	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This guy was innocent u retards! He was an indian with family in thw army. And the girl filed a false complaint as she was balckmailing him for money. U can see hotel CCTV videod of them together. People gave it a communal color!! Now further accuse him.
1262	2015-03-07 00:00:00	After Mumbai massacre government made a categorical statement to disassociate Indian Muslim hand in the massacre. No investigation was made but a statement was released. That was to protect minority. Nagas are a minority group, it is government responsibility to stop press from biased reporting and prevent a Gujarat riots style reporting. Again the aggressor, the rapist, is been spun by media to look like a victim. The hallmarks of love jihad is apparent in this case. Media is reporting against minority nagas to protect majority Muslim man. Stop this atrocity.
1263	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All this protests because the guy lynched was a Mussie. Amnesty International has no voice when the terrorist attack and kill innocent people.  where is their bloody voice at that time.  Ask them to take a hike.
1264	2015-03-07 00:00:00	in india mobs decides to do what it wants...remember 2002 riots, babri demolishion and many more riots accross india and it mostly are hindu mobs. hence police need to shoot to kill whenever this situation arises. we have seen that the police is lenient on hindu mobs
1265	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It is clearly a politics of religion coming into play.Alert every citizen of India.The young mass of Nagaland,have justified the delayed justice.
1266	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Truckers in Assam on Saturday stopped plying their vehicles from here to Dimapur and other parts of Nagaland in protest against the lynching of a rape accused in Nagaland's commercial hub Dimapur on Thursday.
1267	2015-03-07 00:00:00	accusation = guilt if the accused has a Muslim name tag? and don't forget, the place where the man was lynched is an anti-India militancy hotbed which claims the lives of countless Indian police, paramilitary and military personnel.
1268	2015-03-07 00:00:00	now who is the victim here? I cant understand, why people are protesting while the rapist was killed. After Nirbhaya rape, people protesting why rapist not killed. What is happening yaar? I cant understand. scratch, scratch. Is everything in a name?
1269	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I agree with the truckers. Nagland Govt. should pay compensation to the lynched person’s family member. Nagaland Govt. should ensure that this type of mass hysteria does not recur. I think angle of business interest of influence wielding people in this case should be also looked. The guilty shall be dealt with to establish law of the land.
1270	2015-03-07 00:00:00	these are none but the congress agents who are illigal citizens of India now. there is no such truck unions who are so much sympathetic to someone. I believe that they should also be checked thoroughly and must be weeded out from Assamese society.
1271	2015-03-07 00:00:00	this is a great incident. rape accused was claimed to be illegal Bangladeshi, but later it came out that his father was in IAF; 2 of brothers serving Indian army; one died due to injury while serving in kargil.  Some also claiming that it was not a case of rape rather a blackmailing. the mob revolted not against a rapist but against a non-naga accused.
1272	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Truckers in Assam on Saturday stopped plying their vehicles from here to Dimapur and other parts of Nagaland in protest against the lynching of a rape accused in Nagaland's commercial hub Dimapur on Thursday.
1273	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Waiting for this to happen to the Nirbhaya rapists, including the juvenile.
1274	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is a very bad incident in our country profile....Ashme of the administration in Nagaland
1275	2015-03-07 00:00:00	well said hayder
1276	2015-03-07 00:00:00	well said ashwini
1277	2015-03-07 00:00:00	very shameful
1278	2015-03-07 00:00:00	don't know whats more distressing. The fact that government bodies either cannot ensure safety to women or law takes its own course rather than ppl taking it in their own hands or reading comments to this  where people finger pointing each other based on religion, ethinicity etc. The reason why india is in such a sorry state is that we have failed as a nation. Rapists have no fear of law hence commit crime. Also when someone has not been proven guilty no one should be allowed to punish that person. And if you dont want this country to rot then stop involving religion into this. Use your brains not your religion.
1279	2015-03-07 00:00:00	it is high time that law should be amended to punish woman whose character is in question as in this case. medical report says girl was not raped. she filed FIR as the deceased did not agree to pay the amount demanded  by this woman. she is indeed a prostitute
1280	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Now the issue is taking communal colour rather than gender issue
1281	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Clearly administration is not doing its job.
1282	2015-03-07 00:00:00	dog eating christian converts giving the proof that they lack brains... the girl has turned out to be a hore who went with the man on her own wish and the guy who instigated her for police complaint was trying to blackmail him to get 2 lakh rupees... what a shame these chinki idiots have bought to india.. they deserved the thrashing they get all over india..morons.
1283	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas are ultra tribesman mainly doctrined to create their own identity. They fought British and Indian army. They think they do not belong to India and its constitution. As a result no fair justice took place and a man whose crime was not proved was killed by the anti Indian mob. Nagaland govt is at fault and they should provide compensation to the victims family as the loss is irrevocable.
1284	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I trust the SC has taken note of what unfortunately happened here - I t may be a sign of All Indians not getting FRUSTRATED and have lost faith in our SPEEDY judicial system
1285	2015-03-07 00:00:00	it is now officially reported that the rape never happened. that means an innocent man was killed at the behest of a liar, shameless woman. The woman should be booked under murder charges and be also lynched publicly to death
1286	2015-03-07 00:00:00	What happened was unfortunate - let's move on to ensure that this sort of lynching does not repeat. The rapist was guilty. PERIOD.
1287	2015-03-07 00:00:00	if justice delayed that could happen but public not to take law in their hand. they should go to by law to get justice in time and force to government
1288	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas,  first end the Naga rapists and criminals. Then we can clean others, all India  level. Swatch Bharath, Acha  Bharath!
1289	2015-03-07 00:00:00	heard this man lynched was notorious in raping and converting them to his faith and this is not the first instance too
1290	2015-03-07 00:00:00	BJP / RSS Sanghis were going around celebrating the death of a Bangladeshi immigrant and find out the victim was an Ex-IAF man's son and the brother of a brave Kargil martyr. What happened in Dimapur to an Indian national is not just anarchic, lawless but the first indicator of failure of the State under BJP Modi. Evidence of rape or not, lynch mob needs to be dealt with. No connection between whether accused was guilty and how mob rules &amp; mastermind  were allowed in first place declaring accused as illegal migrant BD and then lynched him taking out from central Jail.Compete failure of law &amp; order system in State.
1291	2015-03-07 00:00:00	A Holes, let a rapist be son of holy man or great man it doesn't matter a rapist is a rapist after all, mob justice is not a solution , but high and mighty often get away by our porus justice system , so strong message was sent to all pervert rapist mind, and next read how rape is defined in civil society or indian constitution , its not a islamic defination were woman must be beating chest and hauling with injury mark .
1292	2015-03-07 00:00:00	There is also a rape accused Minister in Modi cabinet.getting away by our porus justice system.. can he be mob lynched ? by Your logic Yes. lets do
1293	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Your Quran.........1. Quran allows rape: Quran (33:50) - O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful ..............2. Quran recommends beating women: Quran (4:34) - Men are overseers over women, by reason of that wherewith Allah hath made one of them excel over another, and by reason of that which they expend of their substance. Wherefore righteous women are obedient, and are watchers in husbands absence by the aid and protection of Allah. And those wives whose refractoriness ye fear, exhort them, and avoid them in beds, and beat them; but if they obey you, seek not a way against them; verily Allah is ever Lofty, Grand
1294	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas are too shrewd and cruel. Take them to New Delhi to handle the corrupted Ministers and Officials!
1295	2015-03-07 00:00:00	who told you???????? you r there in that room?????? next time you can be same position........you cant say that every woman are right
1296	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What's your problem, man? Now it is proved that the guy never raped the girl and Naga people killed an innocent. Naga Police arrested an innocent. I wish to know, how could you guys can apologize?
1297	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These unions should be banned!!! That man was indeed the rapist!!!
1298	2015-03-07 00:00:00	..who told you???????? you r there in that room?????? next time you can be same position........you cant say that every woman are right
1299	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Got your point!!!
1300	2015-03-07 00:00:00	a Muslim rapist will always be victim in India.Muslims can never do wrong as long as they have voting power in India.
1301	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Heard that some elements have approached the Amnesty International against the lynching !!!! HA Ha ha ! The Amnesty guys and gals are dead when they think of the ISIS or the Taliban ! Suddenly all of them come to life.  Sure some jadi-booti from Meanish Tewari of the CONgress !!
1302	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No backing to support protesters of a RAPISTIST.Public has tought a lesson to socity
1303	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Would have been fun what secular-frauds would have said on this case if that good for nothing "Communal Violence bill" was passed by parliament.
1304	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Whatever are all the facts, one thing is clear - If condemning a person arrested on any rape charge is correct, then no need to spend thousands of crores of Rs on police and judiciary. . . . . Moreover, info is coming from ground zero that the family members of this person work in govt and army.
1305	2015-03-07 00:00:00	motive behind the killing rapist is the different story, they don't killed for rape if they want to kill for rape, lots of jail have a proven criminals on jail, against this man even didn't not yet proven the crime, the people killed for some other motive - as per study in news.
1306	2015-03-07 00:00:00	According to electronic media reports lynched rapist Sayed Farid Khan was a Bangladeshi infiltrator who was doing second hand car's business in Dimapur. It is high time infiltration of Bangaladeshis should stop as they are not only earning their livelihood in our land but also are committing heinous crimes.
1307	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Hundreds of Girls are raped add then killed  in India daily But why such a harsh treatment only for a Muslim Bangladeshi? Was only he heavy in the boat of Rapistan?
1308	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Because he is muslim Bangladeshi.
1309	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The killing of Syed Farid Khan, a Dimapur based businessman from Assam by mobs in Dimapur is most deplorable. It is more shocking that the police had not found enough evidence against deceased Khan. Mob justice should not be tolerated.
1310	2015-03-07 00:00:00	We are democratic peoples in a democratic country but lawless. Revamping of system is must.
1311	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The truck union is backing a serial rapist, book all of them for supporting him
1312	2015-03-07 00:00:00	In fact, It was a hidden hatred against Bangladesh and its Muslim people by the Hindu extremists  that came out in the form of extra-judicial killing of an accused. Bangladesh should never expect something  positive from India and its Hindus.
1313	2015-03-07 00:00:00	And you too do not expect anything from us you beggar Paki. Instead of worrying about what happens in India, better you worry about your country that is falling apart with school shootings, bomb blasts, fuel shortage, electricity cuts, non-existent economy.
1314	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These truckers union are muslim organisation backed Assam and north east afe controlled by muslims now and muslims including bangla desh muslims have free run in this region All bangla muslims have to be removed from These areas to avoid social destruction The govt cannot and for vote bank cannot do this ---the people in tnese areas will have to do it themselves if they are to survive
1315	2015-03-07 00:00:00	So now society has sympathisers for rapist and criminals. why truckers organization backing a rapist
1316	2015-03-07 00:00:00	may be the person lynched was a rapist. But even on that grounds the crowd should not resort to such means. However what if the person was not a rapist and was framed. Who is going to investigate that now and who is to be held responsible if he was only a alleged rapist not actually a rapist.
1317	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Before reading the article, just from the headlines I guessed the rapist must have been a Muslim or. Christian. Only these communities with the support of the Left are well organized to intimidate the civil society against any action against their criminals. When Judiciary is ineffective, espcially involving influential persons then people have to take the law in their own hands!
1318	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Really strange, truckers are demanding compensation for rapist who was given mob justice.  People have lost faith in govt.  Now due to Nirbhaya episode, the lose of faith will be much more.
1319	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The chief minister had assured security to all the non-locals in Dimapur and other parts of the hilly state and said that the culprits will be brought to the book soon.
1320	2015-03-07 00:00:00	moral of storysis our country should expedite our justice system and seperate courts should be established to try cases of rapist so within 4 months trial,appeal and reappeal is completed and rapist punished/all such courts should work 365 days a week and evidence be recorded by video confercing/ otherwise such cases i fear may occur again and public will take law in their hands bringing anarchy in our countryof/ prforerma for doctors report,pathological repor/investigating poilce officers report.evidence of witnd nessess to be standardised in q/a form and to be filled by persons signing such statements in presence of first class magistrate and no further cross examination to be called for and punishment should be done on basis of these reportsand legal points and only in rare case witnesses be called to give further cross examination in form of clarification/this will stop all prolong adjourments
1321	2015-03-07 00:00:00	all these association s any where in india who are for rapists must be banned and all their offices sealed
1322	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This rapist missed the opportunity to justify his act and put the blame on the victim in a documentary film by BBC! What a pity!
1323	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Just one thing to be clarified whether the girl was raped or not, if yes......I stand with the crowd!!
1324	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I am sure Mob never believed this guy would be punished due to "known" reasons hence probably took law in their own hands! Not a justification, but this is reality
1325	2015-03-07 00:00:00	You get raped, and should not get punished? what is this? what do you think ? Nagaland is ruled by Taliban? like Assam? Nobody talked when Naga lady got raped..
1326	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Most of those protesting against this incidents are Muslim transporters who control the transporter's association in Assam. Look at the callousness of these Muslims who instead of condemning the act of their ilk are demanding compensation for the rapist. They should welcome this act as it is in compliance with their beloved Shariah where a rapist is stoned to death which is close to public lynching.
1327	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These truckers union are muslim organisation backed Assam and north east afe controlled by muslims now and muslims including bangla desh muslims have free run in this region All bangla muslims have to be removed from These areas to avoid social destruction The govt cannot and for vote bank cannot do this ---the people in tnese areas will have to do it themselves if they are to survive
1328	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It has been flashed in all local news channels and other media that the deceased Syed Sirajuddin was not a Bangladeshi immigrant, but an Indian national from Assam. No wonder the Assamese are protesting! His 2 brothers are serving Indian  Army personnel, his father was with Indian Air force, his mother is getting the Defence pension of their deceased father and above all one of their brothers died in the Kargil conflict! How come the deceased man was a Bangladeshi immigrant? Was it a false case filed against the deceased or was it a case of mistaken identity by the Dimapur mob who went frenzy? Administrative lapse?
1329	2015-03-07 00:00:00	good step. all rapists should be killed like this. why truckers support a rapist! what they will do when their own sister will be victim...Jai ho Nagaland.
1330	2015-03-07 00:00:00	When justice is not done by govt or authorities, public outrage occurs. So it is important that justice is done fairly and quickly.
1331	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I was utterly shocked when in your report on the Dimapur incident you described the man, who was killed by the unruly mob, as an illegal bangladeshi immigrant.. He is a Dimapur based bengali Muslim businessman from Barthal village of Karimganj district of assam.. His two siblings are serving the Indian Army and his late father was an ex-army..The victim of the mob lynching was married to a naga woman and the purported rape victim is his sister-in-law.. The cctv footage of the hotel room, where the alleged rape took place, revealed that no such things happened.. Besides the medical report of the alleged rape victim confirmed that no rape had taken place
1332	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Stop spreading false stories.
1333	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Most of them are Bangladeshi's and just ignore them! They raped and they got justice without much delay and the whole country is proud of Dimapur !! HELL with the truckers and if they are muzzles let them be happy that the dead man is queueing up at the 72s !!
1334	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Has teh rape crime reduced in Nagalad due to lynching?
1335	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The MOB did the right thing now person will think before raping, standing by criminals will encourage them
1336	2015-03-07 00:00:00	he is not a rapist......look at the media channel...girl blame him...they had relation before...video proof is there..
1337	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Jungle law!
1338	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No ! Sharya Law
1339	2015-03-07 00:00:00	One Muslim criminal pig gets killed and Human Rightists and social organisations cry foul but when these Jehadi Satans kill thousands of innocents then these same organisations go into hiding.
1340	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These prorests were not there when rape was done. Who are these truck associations to speak for criminal
1341	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Situation in Nagaland is still tense people in favor of rapist who killed by mobs or against are in anger.
1342	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The 24/7 rape coverage by our sepoy media can whip up passions and animal insticts. Anything in moderation.
1343	2015-03-07 00:00:00	A clear case of loss of faith in judiciary.
1344	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If law is not acting against anti-social elements,then public will take action.
1345	2015-03-07 00:00:00	AGAS TO ACHCHA HE
1346	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No one has right to take the law in his hands. we must let the law and enforcement authority and judiciary do their works as per constitution.
1347	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Did he raped the girl constitutionally ?
1348	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Parochialism &amp; secterianism are our worst enemies.We want a strong united India.
1349	2015-03-07 00:00:00	2 separate issues here... Dont confuse the general masses
1350	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Falsehood=characterless leaders may face the same.
1351	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Sickulars are totally okay if Indian women get r@ped in Bangladesh.  But if some muzzie rat commits a dastardly crime then he has the right to go scott free.  Aren't sickulars ashamed of themselves?
1352	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Had these Bangladeshis not been allowed in India, this kind of situation would have been avoided. Bangladeshis must be behind these truckers' union's boycott of Nagaland.
1353	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Come on!!!! This is not war between muslims and Christians...This was /is fight for justice!!! So,please understand that...This is nothing to do with religion
1354	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I am proud mob has don Justice
1355	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Come on, try to understand. it is a false allegation made by that woman.. video proof is there friend.
1356	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It is due to delay in justice in our courts that people are forced to take such actions. People do not have confidence in our POLICE  AND JUDICIARY. Police and Courts need to fix up a time frame for such and other cases. Justice delayed is justice denied.
1357	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Law must be strict, bold and quicker to punish rapists.
1358	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Truckers should be arrested under POTA. a person killed for what? Rape. SO why the protest. There is politics in this. Have we every heard aMuslim Women being Raped or harassed. No because Hindus dont do it BUT when a Hindu Girl is harassed/raped we see muslim boys involved.
1359	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The truckers are protesting against the killing of Syed Farid Khan and not a business man. Remember the minority BS. Their serious crimes will be justified but the justice meted out will be protested.
1360	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Its a fight basically between islam and Christianity.
1361	2015-03-07 00:00:00	you better PRAY CHRISTIANITY WINS, THEN ONLY HINDUS WILL BE SAFE, UNLIKE LINGAM SLICERS AKA MUSLIMS OUT TO RUIN EVERYONES LIVES.
1362	2015-03-07 00:00:00	No!
1363	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Girls get raped, killed but they didn't get any justice in this country. This is the real punishment. He was a criminal, nothing wrong in killing him. otherwise if gone for justice through law he may get bail or case will go on like nirbhaiya. those criminals have not hanged yet. justice is rare.
1364	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Its not right. Its was mishandled. That guy had previous relation with that girl. and video proof is there that she was there with him in that hotel.Rape word is very dangerous. any woman can misuse that word. so be very careful else next time one of us can be a victim..remember that.
1365	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Striking the wrong pole- we need to protest against the our system of judiciary which has no sense of time .Also they seems to have never heard justice delayed is justice denied

1368	2015-03-07 00:00:00	For them rape is spiritual act. It is not a crime. They don't need to obey India laws. They have special law which honor rapists.

1377	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Clever, how do you know that the person killed was a criminal? Was he convicted by a court of law?  Just because the girl complained of rape you conclude he was a criminal? Tomorrow if a scheming woman alleges rape against you, should you be paraded naked and killed by a mob even before the matter is decided in court? Do you know the whole story behind this incident? Do you know that the girl was the sister-in-law of the killed man, was in some kind of consensual relationship with him and was trying to blackmail him?People like you are no different from the Taliban or the ISIS and should be severely punished for encouraging people to break the law.
1378	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I guess he means that if you do not punish the real culprits people will take law in their hands and then these things are bound to happen. When people decide justice they do not ask for proofs or reports ! The way out is only to punish the 'real' ones fast and effectively.
1379	2015-03-08 00:00:00	And you are assuming that he is not guilty because he is a MUSLIM  //  You would have cared less if he was a non-MUSLIM  //  If INDIANS cannot settle in KASHMIR then why are ILLEGAL BANGLADESHIS allowed to settle in INDIA  ??  //  INDIA is definitely the homeland for INDIAN MUSLIMS but not for BANGLADESHIS and PAKISTANIS  //  We want ILLEGAL BANGLADESHIS to stay in INDIA but we want JEWS in ISRAEL to move back to EUROPE  !!  //  WHAT DOUBLE STANDARDS  !!!

Only then any one will be scared to death to even dream about such a crime against women. Hats off to the all the people in Nagaland, involved in such a good act

1389	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You do understand that the good act you are talking about is murder, right? Not just murder but murder of a possibly innocent man who did not get his day in court. I agree with you that we need a tougher system to deal with rape but lynching without a trial is definitely not it.
1390	2015-03-07 00:00:00	If a woman is r*ped and killed, the r*pist get global recognition. If r*pist is lynched, mob is arrested. If a terrorist is released in j&amp;K, it is rehabilitation but if terrorist kills innocents, it is enquiry.

1396	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What if he was not a rapist? What if he was innocent and framed?
1397	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He wast framed with false rape.  Medical report says the girl was not raped or sexually assaulted.  But feminist media is hiding the fact.  Not reporting the truth clearly.

1399	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Just because he is a man doesn't mean he is guilty, there are chances that he was framed.
1400	2015-03-08 00:00:00	And if was not?  Who has the power to bring him back?
1401	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The guilty people can be seen in photographs and videos etc. but Govt. and police still not taking any action those guilty persons.

1403	2015-03-08 00:00:00	so much commotion and drama over one muzi rapist who got what he deserved..!!! and look at the pic of all the deranged looking muzies demanding 'justice'... why dont they start with getting " justice " for the little girl humped by their profet..???!
1404	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Yes, because in your culture there is no sin in raping your own girls, yesterday one member of Rotten Sect of Stupids (RSS) in Gujarat raped 6 year old girl with 4 feet rod
1405	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You are the rapist of Nirbhaya, you also be dragged and killed in the same manner
1406	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He was lynched because he was a Muslim and not because he was charged with the Rape.
1407	2015-03-08 00:00:00	so what need to do ? If he raped your sister what will you do pisslamist.
1408	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Just yesterday there was a news about two Delhi boys who were framed with such charges and were acquitted. . What if he was not guilty?  And let us say, the charged person was your brother or someone close to you!  Easy to use such emotional words .  hard to justify if one has to deal with it - close to home.
1409	2015-03-08 00:00:00	is that the new line in ur Mosque today,..???
1410	2015-03-07 00:00:00	minorities never see even a rapist as rapist, they see him as their Muslim brother, see how they are supporting by protesting
1411	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims are majority here and nagas are the minority. you are right te majority  are shameless.
1412	2015-03-08 00:00:00	he is talking about pisslamist not muslims.
1413	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes I know he refers to Islam as minority. We should stop using minority for Muslims they are majority. Only under Nehru political calculations can Islam be a minority. In reality they are majority. I'm Hindu and I belive in uthnali devi as the only God. I do not belive any other God. Even though they call me Hindu, I am sure you have no clue about my god. I'm a minority too. Look point is in India only people who should receive quota is SC/ST rest are all majority.
1414	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is know as a pisslam.
1415	2015-03-07 00:00:00	The rapist must be now with 72 virgins.
1416	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is the minimum number the normal muslims get.
1417	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Let us see, if he is able to deliver on his word -&gt; "Just give me one chance to clean the system.

Still  Planned action by Naga people to flash out Non -naga people from Nagaland..They have alreaday occupied so many villages of Assam border area ...torcing assamese peoples houses..destroying tea gardens... There may a relationship betwwen the two..CCtV footage shown in local assamese Channel shows the girl with the man in a hotel. Medical report also negative to proof as rape happened. The man was a permanent resident of Karimgang district of Assam. These type of plaaned crime of Naga people should be severly dealt by Centre and Assam Govt.
1418	2015-03-08 00:00:00	it happens only in india
1419	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Hugely support such an act by public. Naga public are smart, brave and correct. They know that laws in India, especially regarding rapes are useless and at last the convicts will walk free or escape with minimum punishment. So they took law in their own hands and killed the rapist. This is a major lesson to everyone in Nagaland and no one will ever date to commit such an act against women for a long, long time. I salute the spirit of Naga people, though it is brutal. Such demons require this punishment. Hope the same happens for all the rapists, especially in Nirbhaya's case.
1420	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Most of the comments are posted without even reading the full article, it is clearly mentioned in the medical examination of the victim woman that she was not raped, and the accused who is from a family whose two brothers are serving in Indian army and his late father served India as an Air-force Officer...... shame of naga mob
1421	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All the Communal Maggots Commenting Communal Hatred here should for once go to Nagaland and know for theirselves how Non Nagas are Treated in Nagaland....... Each and Every Non Naga Trader there in Nagaland has to pay numerous Taxes to various Naga Terrorist Organisations there and those who stand against them are taken care of the Same way this Victim was Treated..... Its a Strong Possibility that this Man would have been a Security Forces Informer and He Would have been Targeted this way as the Woman Who Levelled Rape Allegations against the Victim has been Tested Negative for Rape
1422	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Nagas are known to carry a Parrallel Government in Nagaland where they treat each and every person from other State as a Foreigner.
1423	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Planned action by Naga people to flash out Non -naga people from Nagaland..They have alreaday occupied so many villages of Assam border area ...torcing assamese peoples houses..destroying tea gardens...

1424	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mob frenzy is not planned action by Naga people. Dimapur is but a city not the whole of Nagaland. 4000- 10,000 people is not the whole of Naga population. We have the British to thank for border issues. CCTV shows a girl whose face is hidden with two men, the CCTV room one can hear 2 men talking saying take video... Dated Feb. 24th between 0138- 0148 hrs. Medical report is not released as it is under investigation. The accused rapist was living in Dimapur for 8 years with his family.
1425	2015-03-07 00:00:00	It is very very unexpected and sad incident. We all should have more Patience
1426	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Patience and allow such demons roam free as it has been done for decades in India?? All such people deserve such a death. As law, never punishes them
1427	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Everybody are so quick at branding him a rapist. Who knows? Has any of you seen or is there any other tangible source which confirms that. This is not any support to the act of rape. This incident will make all the rapist shiver and any one with such intentions fear. Good. But what if this guy was innocent? Also the medical report rules out rape.
1428	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If our judiciary does not improve its stand this is how public will impart justice

Given the hatred the Nagas have for the Bangladeshi Muslim immigrants, one would think that it is the ethnicity and religion of the man that led to the fury.
1430	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A Nagaland Police official in Dimapur said efforts were on to identify those involved in the killing of Syed Farid Khan and that they would be brought to book soon.  The Nagaland authorities on Saturday handed over the body of Khan to his family in Khatkhati area on the Assam-Nagaland border. Later, his body was taken to his native village in Assam's Karimganj district.  Tension gripped Badarpur area in the district after the arrival of the body as the people became agitated over the brutal killing. There was, however, no untoward incident reported from the area.  Khan's brother Jamal Uddin Khan claimed that his brother was framed in the rape case as the medical examination of the girl, who alleged rape, indicated that there had been no sexual assault.  Syed Farid Khan, a 35-year-old second hand car dealer, was accused of raping a 20-year-old Naga woman on February 23 and 24 at different locations. Police arrested him on February 25 and a lower court sent him to judicial custody.

Tight  safety measures also been imposed. So that there is no communal. Tension or further unrest ..
1447	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lawlessness is very dangerous for any country and for that matter any state. Lynching a rape accused publicly in the presence of police is crime. Taking into hands the law is bad in the governance of the state. The police totally incapacitated and made to look like a mute spectator show the law enforcing authority in lowly incompetent state. This has to viewed and seen seriously with steps to revive the low spirit it has suffered. The mob fury is always dangerous and can go berserk at any movement and can create total chaos if not controlled. Assam police lacks professionalism and could not fore see what is in offing and had miscalculated the situation. It has to be inquired into as to what exactly failed the police to take a decisive action. Whether it was the numbers and the sheer magnitude of the crowd or lack of will to overpower the mob is to be studied to stop such things in future and this should become a case in study for the future guidance to the police in general.
1448	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I wonder what will happen if the accused turned out to be innocent .
1449	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hugely support such an act by public. Naga public are smart, brave and correct. They know that laws in India, especially regarding rapes are useless and at last the convicts will walk free or escape with minimum punishment. So they took law in their own hands and killed the rapist. This is a major lesson to everyone in Nagaland and no one will ever date to commit such an act against women for a long, long time. I salute the spirit of Naga people, though it is brutal. Such demons require this punishment. Hope the same happens for all the rapists, especially in Nirbhaya's case. MoreOver  I hold ur profet responsible who started with humping little girls..!!
1450	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This incident raises multiple questions, the saddest of which is whether the man was actually guilty. One reason why we go through elaborate legal procedure is to make sure that a person who is being punished indeed deserves it. When a mob decides to take matter into its own hands, it becomes impossible to ascertain the guilt of a person with reliable certainty. That takes away the legitimacy of anything that is done to that person.
1451	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yet to identify?? all people gatherd there were making videos and clicking pictures of the whole incident, how long will it take to arrest the killers? this slow and lazy juduciary and executive is the only reason why such incident took place at the first time

1453	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Accused became the victim. And everyone is trying to suppress the awakened crowd. And why are these minority organizations crying. The accused was punished because he was a rapist not because his name was Khan.
1454	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Clever, how do you know that the person killed was a rapist? Was he convicted by a court of law?  Just because the girl complained of rape you conclude he was a criminal? Tomorrow if a scheming woman alleges rape against you, should you be paraded naked and killed by a mob even before the matter is decided in court? Do you know the whole story behind this incident? Do you know that the girl was the sister-in-law of the killed man, was in some kind of consensual relationship with him and was trying to blackmail him?People like you are no different from the Taliban or the ISIS and should be severely punished for encouraging people to break the law.

Had this media house has verified or seen the medical record , how can it just publish a mouth piece of accused brother. Where is statement of victims girls ?? Is it a first case in India were mob had killed a rapist or a thief ?? Mob has no right to take law in hand, were as media house has no right to create a biased perception , and media house should stop , doing trial for this there is court, in India most high and mighty get away with rape, if a mob had gathered in support of victim , than there is more than what this media house had published. Is this all because he is a sicular, ?? It's a hypocrite media house.
1464	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Who is the victim? From when did rapist become victims?.  Media is fueling unrest in India. Nagas are minority and so media is trying to spin the case. Muslims are majority in this case and they are the principle aggressor.

1471	2015-03-07 00:00:00	All those who are justifying the murder, need to know a few things that were published in another national level daily newspaper: 1. The accused man was married to a Naga woman. 2. The so-called rape victim was a cousin of the man's wife and used to come to their house frequently. 3. It has been alleged by the man's family that the so-called rape victim had asked for Rs. 2 lakhs from her sister, the man's wife, and had threatened to complain of rape if the money was not given. 4. Medical examination could not confirm sexual assault. Now what is your opinion?
1472	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Made up by media in Assam and should we believe? Two men in CCTV, girl's face cannot be seen with two men conversing in the cctv room. Real or set up?

I have checked so many news media they all have their own hoch poch of news, the only thing that they all write the same is the lynching.

1477	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Thorough investigation should be conducted into the rape incident. The body of the accused should be exhumed to check whether the semen match with that found on the body and clothes of the rape victim.

1517	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Good that she escaped unhurt in the cowardly terrorist attack...
1518	2015-03-07 00:00:00	narrow escape
1519	2015-03-07 00:00:00	thats a way of life in muzlim countries.. what needs to be learnt here is that countries like India need to watch out and monitor its muzi population..strengthen the borders so that muzies are prevented from sneaking in...stop all reservations and free aid and other freebies.. that needs to be done right away.. do not appoint them in decision making positions.. and restrict their living in certain localities only so that they can be contained..!!!
1520	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its as clear as a daylight that Pakistan's rogue ISI and its lackey Lakshar E Toiba are stirring the pot of troubles in Bangladesh by instigating that old radical dame Khaleda Begum and supplanting her violence with fake money and weapons. She is after all a stooge of ISI and a person who is disliked by her own people. She will not succeed  but will die a dog's death soon
1521	2015-03-08 00:00:00	She is running country like a dictator and ruining it.
1522	2015-03-09 00:00:00	On the contrary. She is strengthening it. Allah is on her side as He protects her.
1523	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I am sure she will pretty soon seek asylum in India.
1524	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Paki Beggar, that aint happen for it will be your fellow Pakis within Bangladesh who will try to flee and seek asylum in the haven of terrorists, Pakistan where you live and shiiit inside your mouth. She will stay put and help Bangla get rid of termites like you and make her nation safe and prosprous. Mind it Bangladesh is doing far better than Pakistan and is more prosperous thanks to her far sighted rule. NOW get back to your terror nest in Taliban cave.
1525	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I am wondering when would she flee the country and seek Asylum in India. She has stifled democracy in Bangladesh. It is an autocratic rule.
1526	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Isn't democracy haram in Islam?
1527	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Jihadis will get to this wh0re sooner than you can imagine, Hasina`s fate has been sealed, The wh0re and her entire family will face the wrath of jihadis much worse than what her haaraami b4stard father mujib and her siblings had been went through. Dead woman and her entire family is walking. Clock is ticking it's matter of when the wh0re will meet her haraaami father mujib in hell.
1528	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hey! BlackiePig. The only Wh0res are your own women folks from mother to sisters to wife and daughters who your haraaamm bastrdd father enjoys and later shares it with mullahs in hell when you die a dog's death with your shiiiit inside your mouth
1529	2015-03-07 00:00:00	MY PRAYER FOR THE WELL BIENG OF LONG SUFFERING BANGLADESHI PEOPLLE! Let us all wish for the good and long life of Smt Shaik Hasina the present of  PM of that country so that democracy of true spirit would bloom in the Indian sub continent
1530	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Good that she is safe...
1531	2015-03-10 00:00:00	God bless her as she is pursuing the terrorists relentlessly unlike our Mumtaz Begum.
1532	2015-03-09 00:00:00	god save and give long life to Hasina , pm , bangladesh , who is doing criticle job with extremist .
1533	2015-03-08 00:00:00	it is time hasina took strict action agaist these terrorists
1534	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sheikh Hasina government has no democratic and moral legitimacy. "Kangroo Courts" run aby Awami league and giving very tainted verdicts.
1535	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Sheikh Hasina government is far more legitimate than the Sharia courts.
1536	2015-03-08 00:00:00	looks like she is already in the hit list for administering with iron hand on the radical fundamentalists.
1537	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Could be a staged event, one never knows. What everyone knows is that the Awami League is losing popularity and the BNP sponsored nationwide bandhs and hartals are gaining currency in Bangladesh.
1538	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I am afraid that could be true.
1539	2015-03-07 00:00:00	None of the muslim countries is safe from the clutches of terrorism and Bangladesh is no exception. Its still good that they are fighting among themselves till now and not with us :)
1540	2015-03-07 00:00:00	small bombs after 10 mins of her passing .... must have been done at her own orders. aka modii style!
1541	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No. Just like ISI blasts in Pakistan.
1542	2015-03-07 00:00:00	is it just coincidence that all islamic countries are never peaceful?!?!?  pakistan, egypt, libya, bangladesh, afghanistan, iran, iraq, syria etc etc.
1543	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ever heard of Dubai, UAE, Kuwait, Brunei, Malaysia, Oman ........
1544	2015-03-07 00:00:00	unless the muzi is controlled.they would spread like cancer to make the world unsafe and dangerous. They hate everybody love none.
1545	2015-03-07 00:00:00	These are all pro Pakistan elements, bent upon creating the same chaos and mayhem as in Pakistan.  India could provide assistance, if Bangladesh government requests.  First the border must be sealed.
1546	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Good for her!
1547	2015-03-07 00:00:00	god save her
1548	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Before something more nasty happens India should start taking more pro-active stance. Get active RAW.
1549	2015-03-07 00:00:00	very right
1550	2015-03-12 00:00:00	It was not a serious event but the way its been written here made it crucial, even it was only a minor cocktail blast not a bomb !!!!!!
1551	2015-03-12 00:00:00	GOD BLESS HER..SHE IS TAKING HEAD ON ON ALL TERRORISTS  After many years we have a government headed by present PM in bangladesh who is dealing with islamic terrorists very strongly.. Irony is mamatha didi is exporting terror across the border breeding in her illegal madrassas... indiam sickulars not only spoiling india they are even spoiling the neighbours with their sickularism and appeasement.

1558	2015-03-10 00:00:00	u have resemblance to Hasina. are you her judwaa bhai, lost in kumbh mela?
1559	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Hassina is one of the evil duo who alternatively plagues the nation of Bangladesh with their ill governance.  While all life is sacred, for the sake of the nation, perhaps it would have been best if she indeed had departed to her heavenly abode!  Then again, who knows?  This would have been an even greater evil, since her alter ego would have ruled the nation with absolutely no opposition.

1562	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is unwise to say she escaped   narrowly. She passed the road safely. After five to seven minutes some homemade bomb have blasted.
1563	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If not mistaken Bangldesh is the first Country where two Women are Chieftans of two political parties always carrying on with their political warfare.Indian Bengal is also under control of Mamta Didi.Then differences between India and Bangladesh must get solved solved conveniently more so because of support which India has always been extending since its formation.Teesta water dispute is quite crisp and ripe to be settled soon.Good development.
1564	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Must be done by other ladies supports
1565	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lucky escape.

1570	2015-03-08 00:00:00	For past few days Sheikh Hasina has looked weak when she did not act h-ard on murder of Hindu activist in Dhaka. Islamist took it as weakness and attacked Hasina.  Never show any softness towards Islamists and always b-ang them h-ard as Bush did.
1571	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What softness ? She has already hanged quite a few of them.
1572	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I agree but for few days she has been little soft..aur ye Islamic aise hi mauke ka intezaar kartein hein

1576	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lucky escape, sad that they going through this political storm that is grinding the the country to a halt.  This madness will take them in the direction of Pakistan and other Islamic nations, at war with itself.
1577	2015-03-08 00:00:00	For misleading the people and charging the rivals, Awami League is no less experienced in the art of throwing bombs since beginning.

1590	2015-03-07 00:00:00	This is the second attempt on PM Hasina. There was also a coup attempt earlier, which was thwarted due to timely intelligence from R&amp;AW. PM Hasina is a secular and is not anti India. This is not liked by her political opponents, Pakistan and China. They will surely try to destabilize her government. If thing go wrong in Bangladesh, India should be ready to intervene militarily. India should also completely secure its border, so that millions of Bangladeshi's don't move to India. The border is highly porous and millions of Bangladesh's have moved into India illegally. They should be identified and deported, as this is creating security issues for India, especially in the north eastern states.

All of them must be in their desired jannat-hell instead and rot there permanently with their 72 virgins, barrels of wine and 12 young boys to be enjoy.

1630	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Was this guy convicted of the crime?  Just the other day, two boys were acquitted  .. , as girl had framed them, under pressure from her parents.  What if this guys was also framed?  If guilty ..  courts decide, in innocent, in that case, the same public can do little to bring him back ..
1631	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Is it because he belonged to a particular religion, you assumed he was guilty. What if he is not guilty and has been framed.
1632	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because the man was a victim of false rape allegation. That is why millions of people on the street. Medical report confirmed that the women was not raped or sexually assault.  Read other news media.  Feminist medias are not reporting the act of criminal women who filed false rape cases. The criminal women was sister-in-law of the man-victim and asked for money, etc. and it was a family settlement issue.  Feminist medias are not reporting men side of the story.  Feminist medias are hiding the act of criminal women who filed false rape case on the man. He was not rapist.  The women is rapist, she raped the man to death by using women laws, false rape case.  Can you protect the -victim man?  If any women says you are a raped her then do you have any value?  No. Women has value - you are in jail.  No justice for you in the laws. Women is the laws, court, police, media, minister, politician, everything.  Women empowerment to torture man. No one is speaking for this victim-man.  The criminal women is not even arrested roaming around on the street to rape and loot another man.

Also he should kiss each and every pen!s he sees like gaandu shiva. Shiva being an ardhanaaari and euunuch his ling doesn’t work. If u don’t understand then shiva’s avataaar with the name bobby darling will come on earth in future. Further every hindu should not eat cows as cows were krishnaa’s fav ssexx buddies.krishna used to see naked gopis bathing and used to go and fucck cows and he probably was eunuch dats y radha never married him and also raam was eunuch too n dats y sita ran to lanka to get fuccked by raavan and get oral by him as raavan had 10 heads.

1639	2015-03-08 00:00:00	u think as your poor mentality....you ask your parents are they happy with your born.
1640	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You are stupid people to comment. We don't have a monarch. Its simply brutal to kill someone like this. All 4000 people who are convicted must be punished for minimum 5 years.
1641	2015-03-08 00:00:00	and i guess its brutal to rape or harass women too....
1642	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No, the criminal women who filed the false rape on the man should be sentence to death first. The criminal women is not even arrested.  Feminist media is hiding the criminal act of the women.  Medical report confirmed that the women was not raped or sexually assaulted. The man was a victim of a false rape allegation by the women and media.
1643	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hats off to the people of nagaland and assam who did this.this is exactly what is needed in rest of the country.nirbhaya rape accused should be lynched as well and same should be done to all who commit this henious crime.
1644	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It's quite possible the guy was innocent..You would still lynch him?  India is certainly backward, and uncivilized. Due process is just on paper. There are actual raapists running around, and police and government officials don't do their jobs, and you have a crowd of brainless people, who look at this man - looks foreign, and then kill hom.  Utterly shameless, and people like you incite these crimes.  BTW: I know Nagaland pretty well. To Nagas Hindus and Muslims from the 'Mainland' look the same - you are not Naga. That is sufficient. Also FYI, Assam is a different state, and the guy killed was from Assam.
1645	2015-03-08 00:00:00	let us leave this matter to court, I think they can judge it better....
1646	2015-03-08 00:00:00	* WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished dream Yet you made sure she never materialized her dream Going to a movie with a buddy when the night was still young Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so young her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-drenched parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that devastated mummy Will scorch the earth? You never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so heartless to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Why you didn't I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Was it too much to ask for?
1647	2015-03-08 00:00:00	In case a rapist is lynched, why should there be any protest. Is it because he belonged to a particular religion?
1648	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So allegations are proof? Where did you study dear boy? School for idiots?
1649	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hello my dear Muslim commentors....The proving of rapist of rape will take several years. Further, your community is known for such activities.... The mob rule was the best possible solution...Beware and learn from it...
1650	2015-03-08 00:00:00	U baustrad .....why all the big officials are suspended.....for what reason government is asking the Police officials to submit the medical report....wait one day you will be judged.....the day is not far.....
1651	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Basterd, let your mother and sisters loose in the night and see how you're hindu brothers will forfill all their sexual fantasy. ... The whole world knows hindus male's are rapist beasts
1652	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what had happen to this country... where is the law and regulation has gone..mob killed him because he was of particular religion even it was not proved that he has done rape...same full naga people...
1653	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes....killed because he belongs to a particular religion. Muslims have been attacking and raping other women for centuries. Now that you have been made to pay for it, you are protesting? Do you know why you are muslim? It is because your ancestors were cowards and your gr8 grandmom wh0red herself to arab invaders and your cowardly gr8 granddad converted to islam when threatened with death. And to cover up their cowerdice, they told you a fancy story that they converted because they say islam is a better religion. But the truth is....they converted because they were cowards.
1654	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yesterday, a Kausal Chauhan allegedly raped a six year old kid with a four feet long TMT bar. The incident took place in Ahmedabad, the citadel of Indian progress. Let us see what people learned from Dimapur incident.
1655	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Very unfortunate developments. It would have been in the fitness of things, had a probe been made to prove the guilt and then the person concerned brought before law.
1656	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The truth is already out. The medical exam of the alleged girl proved that there was no sexual assault and that Syed Farid was framed..
1657	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I feel ashamed this happened in Nagaland my state, but people need to understand it is not the nature of people here to do that, the real culprit behind the mob violence in dimapur that lynched a Muslim man was instigated for many days by E.M.Odyuo, the administator of a popular naga page " in Facebook which has been repeatedly posting articles against Muslim Assamese and immigrants in general and unrestrained comments which the adminstrator of this page allowed, which called for killings of Muslim Assamese and Bangladeshis in Nagaland.  During the mob violence E.M odyuo also was seen inciting physical violence against Muslim Assamese and immigrant minorities for them to be slaughtered. In his facebook page there is always hatred towards various people,other naga tribals, other people from other parts of India, Muslims, Hindus etc.
1658	2015-03-08 00:00:00	hmmmm....seems like you are in favor of the rapist....hypocrite
1659	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Like it or not, Nagaland has one less rapist, he even has a pending rape case.. no wonder medical report changes overnight, a victim of rape in India has to go through this, people supporting rapist, we talk about rape free India.. its gonna be a long way.
1660	2015-03-08 00:00:00	a sad thing, could hav avoided
1661	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is no unrest. Politicians are creating it
1662	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The man was a victim of false rape allegation. That is why millions of people on the street. Medical report confirmed that the women was not raped or sexually assault.  Read other news media.  Feminist medias are not reporting the act of criminal women who filed false rape cases. The criminal women was sister-in-law of the man-victim and asked for money, etc. and it was a family settlement issue.  Feminist medias are not reporting men side of the story.  Feminist medias are hiding the act of criminal women who filed false rape case on the man. He was not rapist.  The women is rapist, she raped the man to death by using women laws, false rape case.  Can you protect the -victim man?  If any women says you are a raped her then do you have any value?  No. Women has value - you are in jail.  No justice for you in the laws. Women is the laws, court, police, media, minister, politician, everything.  Women empowerment to torture man. No one is speaking for this victim-man.  The criminal women is not even arrested roaming around on the street to rape and loot another man.
1663	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is no Bengali Muslim. All of them are Bangladeshis.
1664	2015-03-08 00:00:00	looks like it was a cold blooded murder by the mob, the girl was after the money instead...
1665	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Now the Nagaland government will backfoot and try some stupid tricks.
1666	2015-03-08 00:00:00	sad
1667	2015-03-10 00:00:00	15000 gathers to honour this rapist.

Glorified is God above all that they attribute to Him! (91) All-Knower of the unseen and the seen! Exalted is He over all that they associate as partners to Him! (92)"  Quraan (23:91-92)&lt;br/&gt;
1669	2015-03-10 00:00:00	"Since unofficial reports suggest that there was no rape, what kind of unofficial report? are you mad?
1670	2015-03-10 00:00:00	  "O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): Verily! those on whom you call besides God, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought." (Quraan Ch 22:73) 
1671	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Anybody who favors and make merry over the tyranny and brutality he should to know that it is universal truth that one day he will also have to suffer in such situation by the law of nature for imparting lesson.

1673	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A REQUIEM FOR NIRBHAYA "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!

1683	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This seems to be a fabricated rape.. Girls r misusaing rape every now &amp; then...  without even confirmed by medical report how the accuse is murdered without showing a single sign of existence of humanity in those mentally sick mob.. This seems to be a bigger conspiracy to target minority.
1684	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is vigilante action. This is a direct outcome of failure of Indian police and Indian Kangaroo courts to provide quick convictions of rapists. It is time to have the judges sacked. Millions of court cases are pending.
1685	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ìf it is true the girl should be given exemplary punishment so that no girl would dare to do such a thing ever.

1691	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The incidences of rape is rampant in India on daily basis, but there is no precedence since 1947 that such an accused has ever been dragged out of jail from the custody of police openly. His prime crime was that he was a Muslim. Syed Farid Khan was dragged out of jail from the police custody by mob and lynched in public whereas it was yet to prove the charge framed against him. It is the real face of India for Muslims.

1700	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Long live the mob.  These muslim b@stards think they can abuse any non muslim girl like their popat mohamad and get away?  Hunt every qurani p!g and roast them.
1701	2015-03-09 00:00:00	dont simply blame ok. let me ask you one question . who were the people in the mob ? do you know..... they are your nagas,your student ,your youth.
1702	2015-03-08 00:00:00	u r an illiterate n uncivilized guy @ whiplash
1703	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why this much action when a rapist is killed? should a biriyani be served to him for an achievement by keeping him alive?
1704	2015-03-09 00:00:00	May be this incident can take the form of communal/community -riots.
1705	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is not a mere rapist punishment case, lot people in india in different jails for different reasons do indian react same for all criminals, why it happened in Nagaland only it is Assam Nagaland problem, do indian society support crime, on killing of Indragandhi SIKH were punished but not same when Rajiv Gandhi killed!!!
1706	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is no rapist only an ACCUSED
1707	2015-03-09 00:00:00	So MODI is not guilty of any GUJRAT RIOTS until proven until in a COURT  //  THEN, WHY DO MUSLIMS WANT MODI JAILED WITHOUT ANY JUDICIAL INDICTMENT  ??  //
1708	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Well. this is a big thing. It may be hard to understand. One side there is a chief minister, with great powers, police, money, bhakts[ a politician] and other side a man whom his own country is trying to disown. Politics is a very complex field here a politician has the powers to destroy evidence, threaten judge, control police. No one really knows whether modi was after the riots. The courts have acquitted him due to lack of evidence. But it is also true that he failed his duty as the chief minister to control the riots.
1709	2015-03-10 00:00:00	MODI was investigated for this one item for 10 years which is: WAS HE GUILTY OF NOT CONTROLLING THE RIOTS and he was found not guilty //  He did call the ARMY within the time frame required if the POLICE fail to control rioting  //  But the rioting was too big  //  Just like he failed to prevent the burning of 59 HINDU TRAIN PASSENGERS that no MUSLIM wants to ask MODI  //  But MUSLIMS are upset over one lynching in NAGALAND  //  As a TRUE INDIAN you want to speak out against 10 MILLION ILLEGAL BANGLADESHIS living in the NORTH EAST just like you speak out against JEWS in PALESTINE //  Why is that ILLEGAL BANGLADESHIS can settle in INDIA but INDIANS cannot settle in KASHMIR ??  //
1710	2015-03-10 00:00:00	there are many justification for failures. And dont generalise people on the basis of religion.u say muslims are upset with lynching but there were muslims who were part of lynching.As far as bangladeshi issue is concerned the BSF has reportedly called it an political issue in which many bengali speaking indian citizens are called bangladeshi. The last one -- I think indians live in jammu n kashmir. but yes there are restrictions on people who r not native to the state. due to some political reasons. the power to remove this restriction is with the central govt. which i suppose is happy with the present state.
1711	2015-03-08 00:00:00	that will be way, if the case is opened in courts and will continue to remain for years
1712	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NOT TRUE... this much married muzi was not someone innocently accused.. forensic evidence, and witness accounts were taken as well which point to this guy... only thing remaining was the sentencing by the judge.. the victim is the girl not this married muzi rapist..!!! get over it.. true paki.!!!!!!!!
1713	2015-03-09 00:00:00	YOU  ARE  POSSIBLY  HUMILIATED  AND  INSULTED  IN  AMERICA  EVERY  DAY  BECAUSE  OF  YOUR  COLOUR .  TO HIDE  YOUR  HUMILIATION  AND  INFERIORITY  COMPLEX  YOU  WANT  TO  PLAY  THE  BIG  MAN  BY  CALLING  MULIMS DEROGATORY  NAMES .
1714	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why don't you get a life?  Quit Islam.
1715	2015-03-09 00:00:00	muslim in itself is derogatory to any human being.
1716	2015-03-09 00:00:00	THEN WHY DO MUSLIMS WITH MOSTLY DARK SKIN LIVE IN U.S.  ??  //  BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT HARASSED AND THEY ARE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME EARNING DOLLARS AND ALSO CARRYING OUT TERRORISM NOW AND THEN  //
1717	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Islam allows rape of non-Muslim. So, not even accused.
1718	2015-03-08 00:00:00	from where you got this fatwa?  seem  you are not a muslim
1719	2015-03-08 00:00:00	as if u muzies dont go around using fake ids.. hahahaha
1720	2015-03-09 00:00:00	yups they need to use fake id...cos nobody likes them
1721	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Look at the past 1000 years history. Mughal soldiers raped even dead non-Muslims women whenever they got an opportunity. All captured daughters ,wives of kings and courtiers were taken as sex -slaves.
1722	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Hedaya Vol. I Book III, page 71 (Ref. 6)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case of one of two wives suckling the other-If a man marry an infant and an adult and the latter should give milk to the former, both wives become prohibited with respect to that man [their husband], because if they were to continue united in marriage to him, it would imply the propriety of joint cohabitation with the foster-mother and her foster-daughter, which is prohibited, in the same manner as joint cohabitation with a natural mother and daughter-It is to be observed on this occasion, that if the husband should not have had carnal connexion with the adult wife, she is not entitled to any dower whatever, because the separation has proceeded from her, before consummation :-but the infant has a claim to her half dower.&lt;br/&gt;

1725	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Muhammad married 12 wives  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a true picture of Muhammad?s collection of wives. Muhammad married between 13 to 22 wives. The most authentic biography of Muhammad (Ref. 3) tells us that Muhammad had at least 13 (when I counted, I found this to be 14) wives (see Ref.3 page 794). Some writers even suggest that Muhammad had up to 28 wives. This is not to say that the only women Muhammad had in his harem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He had at least two concubines namely Maria and Rayhana. Maria was presented to Muhammad by the Coptic head of Egypt while Rayhana was a booty from the genocide of Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe that lived in Medina. Both these sex slaves were of extreme beauty and very young when Muhammad possessed them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Islamists often object vehemently when we mention that Muhammad had concubines besides his regular wives. They will often give convoluted logic to demonstrate that the Prophet of Islam never had concubines. Well, here is what Ibn Ishak writes about Maria:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ibn Hisham?s note 129&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ibrahim?s mother was Mariya the Copt. Abdullah b. Wahb from I Lahia told me that Mariya was the prophet?s concubine. The Muuqauqis presented her to him from Hafn in the province of Ansina. (Ibid, page 711).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muhammad married Sauda when she was 65 years old. &lt;br/&gt;ameen
1726	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The popular belief is that Lord Brahma produced the Vedas. He is said to have established sexual relationship with his daughter Saraswati

1728	2015-03-08 00:00:00	some islamists believe that : stealing, raping killing infidels is not a crime.....cause we are non believers !
1729	2015-03-08 00:00:00	My dear brother Imtiaz, Recalling the horror and brutality our brother went through while lynched by the mob of barbaric infidels, this is not a time for infighting. Rather we should stand by each other and unite. Just for your reference, Quran 4.24 “(prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.”  Quran 23.1-6: “Successful indeed are the believers, who…, And who guard their private parts, Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable.”  Note the term “whom your right hand possess”, which means slaves. Rape of the captured female slaves is also sanctified in verses 4:3, 4:25, 24:33, 70:29-35, 33:50-52, and others.  Lets try to be more sincere in reading the Holy Quran and Hadith on a regular basic. We dont need the garb of democracy to receive the mercy of Allah. May peace be with you my brother.
1730	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You Coward " Ali Zaheer" , A Rakshas, A Sataan, Iblees, Shaitaan in Disguise of a Muslim. You don't have to worry about the Lynched person, God will take care of it. Do you have any Guts to come in front of any True Muslim and Speak like this?   ====================================================== Dear Indians and Everyone Reading this person's (Ali Zaheer's) Comments- Non Muslims or Muslims- Please get to know that He is Not a MUSLIM at all. He is a Muslim Hater, and his job is to malign Islam as much as possible. (Its a different thing that its already maligned to unthinkable levels). Using a Muslim name in comments to fool everyone. In Islam the Punishment for Rape is Death Sentence. But the accused should be given a chance to prove if he is innocent. Islam abolished Slavery more than 1000 years ago. Before Islam Slavery was normal in those days. Many People who accepted Islam, had Slaves (Male as well as Female to work for them) with them before they became Muslims. The Verses in Quran speaking about the Slaves were about those Slaves. Islam wanted to eradicate the Slavery System, But It is not possible to do it instantly. So Islam made certain rules to achieve the goals of Zero Slavery. Some of them are 1.Releasing a Slave from Slavery is one of the biggest Charity. 2.If any person who owns a Female Slave, and if he had Sexual Relation with her,  She will no longer remain a Slave after that Relation. She would have all the rights, A Wife would have. And the Children born will have the rights over the Property of their Father.  In this way Islam ended the practice of Slavery. I Request all Indians to Get Hold of this "Ali Zaheer" and Hang him coz it looks like that he commits Rapes Frequently.

1733	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You need to be really sick in modern world to practice the portions of Quran and Hadith you mentioned.... EVEN IF what you wrote is true....     And if what you wrote is true, then I understand why many modern Muslims just pray to Allah, and not read these Quarn, and Hadith...
1734	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So what you mean is that all modern muslims do not believe in Korrran and Hadith and believe in Allah who is the central point of Korrran.  Great. You slowly will evolve into a Muslim over the time and convert yourself into Islam which defines Logic that contradicts with itself. If you want proof, Go-ogle for all those controversies on Korrrran.
1735	2015-03-08 00:00:00	To make my point clear, I am as proud a Hindu, as a christian is of his religion, and A Muslim is of his religion.... Lets take an example...: I am hindu, I trry my best to practice "Nishkaam karma" of Gita, Practice MonoGamy as idealized by Rama, but Don't practice Agni-Parikhsa of Sita, and abandoning my wife just because someone commented about her... I hope you understand i am talking about practicing the core of reclgion,  the part you like, and which is according to Modern times.... Similarly some moderate Muslims subscribe to very specific, currently relevant portion of Quran.. and not the portion which says 4 marriages, and raping kafir ladies (I haven't read Quran myself though)... and Practice Contraxception to keep number of choldren low so that they  can give them good education, adn quality of life... And definitely Most of Indian Muslim are diffrent than ISIS, Libya/ Boko Haraam, Middle east or Pakistani Muslims.... if you care to look around, you will know that,... In fact, Recent events have made me believe that partition of India was a BLESSING IN DISGUISE... all Radical Muslim went to Pakistan.. and only moderates stayed in India ... so the result 67 years down the line.. Pakistan is in Radical Chaos.. where as Despite having Second largest Muslim Population, (larger than in Pakistan) India is still Much peaceful.. and better off... I hope I have clarified my point with example...
1736	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No wonder Hindusthan is suffering because of people like you.

1738	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This has been in practice for hundreds of years. Where do you think ISIS &amp; Boko Haram are still practicing this. Why all this doubt? Even the Pakistan Army did this in 1971 Genocide and local Pirs confirmed rape of infidels is ganimat.
1739	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NOT everything which has been practiced need to be practiced for ever.. and credit should go to the one who use their own judgement over whats written in any book... rather than blindly follow it..
1740	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You need to get out of your ignorance before you are enslaved by true believers aka muslim. Your eyes will remain closed forever or what? It has been happening for 1400 years!Muslims invaded Sindh in Hindustan,took thousands of women to arabia,afghans ,Turks invaded and took thousands of women to Afghanistan,and in mopala and 1947 and then in Kashmir they did what you cannot even imagine to Hindu and Sikh women .And still you believe that Muslims will show mercy on you?
1741	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Paki Army and it's Jamat-e-Islami collaborators raped 2-3 lac Hindu Bengali women during Bangladesh liberation war. Nasty pictures of women tied to poles without clothes can still be seen on websites. Islam is the only religion which is based on hatred for non-believers or even animals rest all religion are based on love and sacrifice.
1742	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Keep it in mind, no religion teaches bad things to the followers, but the people follow it wrongly. So focus on the act done the man, not on his religion.
1743	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Then death of that main is justified then.
1744	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ok...u got to know this from ur biological father or real father.
1745	2015-03-08 00:00:00	son of b***ch...  where in islam alllows that..  we can understand that you have given wrong name
1746	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dearest Muslim Brother, please read the Quran and Hadith regularly. I know most of us are unable to be sincere enough to meet the standards laid by our beloved Prophet Because of the wrong influences of the hypocrisy called Democracy etc. For your reference-Quran 4.24 “(prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.”  Quran 23.1-6: “Successful indeed are the believers, who…, And who guard their private parts, Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable.”  Note the term “whom your right hand possess”, which means slaves. Rape of the captured female slaves is also sanctified in verses 4:3, 4:25, 24:33, 70:29-35, 33:50-52, and others.  India calls itself secular. So, minorities should be protected. As you can see that the need of the hour is to extend the Muslim Personal Law Board for criminal code of law as well and just not civil code. If Sharia is applied, this will not even be considered as a rape. Moreover these fake medical test will not be taken as evidence in Sharia court. The lady should produce 4 Muslim pious men of good standing in society to prove if at all she was violated. think of the humiliation and pain our brother went through those horrifying moments when he was mercilessly lynched by those brutal infidels. And all that just because he was true to the instructions of our beloved Prophet's messge on Allah and just enjoyed a non believer girl. Islam never considers this as anything wrong. please read the Quran and Hadtih regularly.  May the mercy of Allah be with all our brothers. Peace

1764	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Umme Kulthum: Umme Kulthum was 4 or 5 years old when Umor married her. This child was his most favourite wife (just like prophet Mohammad). There is a great controversy about the identity of this child bride of Umor. Many Islamists claim that she was the daughter of Ali and Fatima. Others claim that Umme Kulthum was the posthumous daughter of Abu Bakar and Habiba. Abu Bakar died (13 A.H.) a few months before Umme Kulthum was born. She was the half sister of Ayesha. So, Umor asked Ayesha for the hand of Umme Kulthum when she (Umme Kulthum) was only 4 - 5 years old. Ayesha agreed and Umor and Umme Kulthum got married.

1775	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Please apply your Islamic in Islamic country.Law of rascal. .
1776	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Naga culture allows mob lynching and killing of rapist.  So, not even murder.
1777	2015-03-08 00:00:00	that needs to be practiced in other areas too as law has failed in our nation badly, especially in these cases
1778	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Then why do we have law and courts ?
1779	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Spoken like a true muzzie!
1780	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Spoken like a blood idolator dirty hindu RSS chaddi. Let me recall what the Quran reminds u infidel mthrfkrs  Quran 9:5 :  "Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the IDOLATERS wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."  dont forget we ruled this land for 1000s years. And we will have our separate Criminal code under Muslim Persona Law board. Lets c how u Telugu, Tamil Marathi, Bihari, Bengalis, Dalits, Brahmins, Shudras can stop us
1781	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Well I dont know abt ur fact making capabilities. But the fact is that india is governed by the constitution. If you truly want to follow ur facts then please go to somalia. And Of course using fake name darpok.
1782	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If you are in India, you will be killed for a rape of a non-muslim, as the B***** Khan is done away. So don't dare to look at India.
1783	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ali Zaheer ur a curse on this earth
1784	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ali Zaheer is a true Muslim who digested whole of the Korrran. There are still some good muslims in the world because they have never understood Korrrrran.
1785	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ali zaheer is neither muslim nor does he belongs to any other faith. He is an evil at work.
1786	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what the fk you want to say motherfkr... stop ur disguise and show real face
1787	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I believe that Islam allows it only for sex slaves, not for all non-muslims. So, he cannot use religion as an excuse.
1788	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its correct you won't be Muslim
1789	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Pull out all hindu rapists too from jail and kill them. He was only killed by hindus because he was non hindu..
1790	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muzzies of India should be deal with Sharia law in India as this is only way to curb them- democracy and its laws don;t work for muzzies in India.
1791	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Medical report of the alleged rape victim is still awaited. At least in absence of a confirmed medical report, you cannot say that the allegation was true.
1792	2015-03-08 00:00:00	there was forensic evidence...plus witness corroboration... get ur facts... the girl is the victim not the muzi rapist..!!!!!!!!!!!!
1793	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because this a democratic country not an anarchy. Further whether or not he was  a rapist is up to the law to decide not the keyboard ninjas like you.
1794	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The country is NOT a democracy, it is a free republic.  Democracy is a process not a state.   Only the Govt is constituted and operated through a democratic process.  There is no requirement of democracy in all non govt matters.
1795	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is an evidence of Bangladeshis doing crimes
1796	2015-03-08 00:00:00	muzi.. the very fact its a democratic country is why the girl dared to report the rape to the police, the police gathered all witness accounts and forensic evidence and arrested the muzi.. if it was a arabic  cesspit he would have been beheaded by now... so the victim here is the girl not ur muzi rapist..!!!  and the mere fact u r yapping on the keyboard with a fake id.. proves the democracy exists too.. any where else u would have police at ur door for posting anti national comments.. get it.. muzi...!!!!!!!!
1797	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Well the very fact that even though ur every comment inciting communal hatred is against the law, the police has not taken any action. This shows how strong our democracy is. I agree that in s arabia justice is served according to their countrys law. No law of saudi is applicable in india vice versa. Let me enlighten u with another fact that due to our so called strong democracy women have all the rights to exploit men through feminist laws. India is the only country where rape laws dowry,harassment laws are gender based. Are men not humans do they not have human right. Are all women good and the only devil resides in a man ???
1798	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Democracy? My foot.
1799	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If u have a problem with our Democracy u r free to leave.
1800	2015-03-08 00:00:00	do u express only or like to act too???  but justice and law must be respected , must punish a criminal and provide justice to victim - revenge and punishment are different at all, one is system other is crime
1801	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There are many Nirbhya-man as well. There are many Indian sons in jail because of false rape/498a/dv case filed by India daughters. Indian sons also need help and protection from legal terrorism on man.  We want Indian women to denounce these criminal women who files false rape/498a/dv cases on men and come forward to support Indian victim-sons.
1802	2015-03-08 00:00:00	How do you know he was rapist? Have you received medical report of girl or have you smelt her "V"?
1803	2015-03-08 00:00:00	no Sir only that sentence should be given by courts
1804	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Agreed, but Indian laws are vey old and there are  lot of loop holes in it. It needs amendment. Criminal like rapist walks away from the jail and roam freely after spending sometime in the jail just because of the weak laws we have.
1805	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Indian courts take long time to order the sentence.  AFZAL GURU, Thirteen years, Mumabi Blast Case, 16 years, Kasab 7 years.  Lot of people with muscle and money stay out of jail, like LALLOOO, Robert VADERA, Ex PM Monkey Singh.  Courts are good for travesty of justice.  It is good, that people sometimes are showing effervescence of social unrest.
1806	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You are a danger to society - if accusation was enough to justify death the world would have been depopulated in short order.
1807	2015-03-08 00:00:00	no one have the right to take law into his her own hands,
1808	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Does this man have right to rape women ?????????????............when your daughter, sister or wife get raped...................you will give the same lecture........................................
1809	2015-03-08 00:00:00	And if u r the victim would u still give the same lecture. There is judiciary to take care of it and give punishment to the criminals.
1810	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what about the girl that got raped..? muzi..??? she is the victim .. not the rapist muzi.. BTW  he was the confirmed rapist.. not merely accused.. the forensic evidence , witness testimony was all against him.... only he was not sentenced by the judge... so who is the VICTIM.. the girl or the muzi,...???
1811	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what is muzi
1812	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Talk sense!  Don't sound like a broken record. Nobody is saying that a rapist should not be punished. Only saying that an innocent soul should not be punished. Don't be sentimental . It appears from many reports that the man was framed!
1813	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Tu Gndu Udhar Comment Nahi Karega Jidhar Proof Hai......... Jah Pe 6 Yr Ki Ladki Ka Rape Tere Hi Religion Wale Ne Kiya Hai Gujrat Mai.............. Lekin Tu Jaise Anti Muslims RSS Ke Bikni Idhar Zaror Apni Gnd Mrwane Ate Hai Jidhar Proof Nahi Ke Usne Rape Kiya................... Tere Previous Comments or Sabhi Anti Muslims Comments Hai Tere...........
1814	2015-03-08 00:00:00	But the largest number of rapes are committed by Islamic Army of Pakistan in Bangladesh in 1971. Thats the biggest achievement of  Islam so far.
1815	2015-03-08 00:00:00	wrong
1816	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Tere Pass Proof Hai Ke Use Rape Kiya ...... Gndu?
1817	2015-03-08 00:00:00	We have a system which requires that guilty should be convicted even though there may be several flaws in it. So long as we are not abandoning it, we have to follow it for the simple reason of orderliness. Nobody supports a criminal who raped. But the law of the land does not award death sentence for rape. So don't you think it is unlawful to have killed him?
1818	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because an accused can even be you, if charged as such by any girl, should you find yourself in another community's area. Then we'll say the say and welcome your lynching. Would that be ok? Think what can be the ramification.
1819	2015-03-08 00:00:00	muzi.. he was not merely accused .. he was the ONLY one accuse.d.. cos the girl fingered him as her rapist  there were witness corroboration... only thing remaining was sentencing by the judge.. so YEAH .. he was  rapist.. not someone innocently accused.. get over it muzi..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..
1820	2015-03-09 00:00:00	So now u have better proofs than the police itself come on man, get over ur communal talk
1821	2015-03-08 00:00:00	How long will they use the minority tag one they or their friends or relatives are culprits?? They know using this is the only way to escape law, court cases. This has been misused only when people from that community are culprits otherwise they never claim to be one. This tag becomes automatic shield to everything. Only this advantage is given in India to these people and irony is they claim injustice after getting all protection and equal rights
1822	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Was he a rapist? Allegations are not the same as fact. You your brain when making these comments. And even if he were a rapist, do you want mob law in India? What if the police were pressed to solve a case and they found you or your family member in the street and arrested them?  Don't be so shortsighted, and give thanks to God we live in a Secular Democratic  Republic.
1823	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Wonder how an id!ot like you became a moderator for this site?
1824	2015-03-08 00:00:00	simple logic no hate- Hindus are idol worshippers and Muslims are told to k ill and hate idol worshippers- best solution- send bengalis muslims out
1825	2015-03-08 00:00:00	the point is, it was not proved that he was indeed guilty. Imagine yourself being framed in a false rape case, and mob coming to thrash you to death. No one is asking to serve him biryani, but atleat prove that he is guilty first
1826	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You mean to say all the criminals should be dragged out of prison and killed like this by public? Then what's the use of having prisons and police?
1827	2015-03-08 00:00:00	actually he was innocent , if the story was true yes he should nt be served biryani and deserved this but he was framed by the girl.
1828	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The judiciary is there to decide. Do you want the justice of a lynch mob to prevail in this country? BTW, our government, judiciary, police and civil servants had better wake up fast and confront the burning issue of rape head on before it is too late. Everyone seems to be in a self induced coma.
1829	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So you wanna serve him Biriyani for a long time. Tell me how many are convicted in Rape cases? And how many are walking free? How much time will it take for each case? And how many are on bail
1830	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Another fact is that the person who is accused is a Muslim. And that's why this much drama. Had it been some other religion, will they act. I see some commenting that Islam allows rape. So what will jury do? Based on Isalmic personal law he will be let free. So the decision of mob is perfect and Correct.
1831	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Believe me if it were YOU instead of that guy the same drama would be taking place and i would still be defending you irrespective of your religion.Based on Islamic law he would be stoned to death if found guilty and if it were you some ash0ls would be fighting on this comment that this is not a muslim country hence  stoning should not be allowed.
1832	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Actually the man was handed to the mobs coz he was a Muslim otherwise you have rapists of Gujarat like Bajrangi in jail having dhoklas and Kodnani who arranged for mass murders and rapes and convicted as such out on bail, so don't be disengenious.
1833	2015-03-09 00:00:00	HOW  DO  YOU  KNOW  HE  WAS  A  RAPIST  YOU  UNEDUCATED  IDIOT.  THIS  MAN  WAS  NOT   CONVICTED .
1834	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If you were accused of rape when u were innocent and this was done to you probably your stance wouldnt be the same
1835	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why women organization is not coming forward to look into this rape case?? Why??  Ban women organization, it is a terrorist organization who creates legal terrorism on man. The man (Nirbhya-Khan) is now bead, he wasn't rapist. Feminist paid Medias are not reporting the truth as truth that he was a victim of false rape allegation. Mob killed the man because he was a Bengali-muslim and married a naga women. Naga people did not like it. Now his naga-sister-in-law filed a false rape case on him because rape case is more stronger than 498a. The dead body sent to mother and father but his naga-wife sitting at Naga did not accept her husband's dead body. Feminist media is hiding all these truth information. He was not a rapist. He is a victim of a false rape accusation. It can happen to you as well anytime the what will you do? You don't have to rape anyone. India is not safe for man because of these legal terrorist on men
1836	2015-03-08 00:00:00	1) He was innocent until proven guilty by courts 2) there was no evidence of rape found in medical examination
1837	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because he wasn't rapist.  Media is not reporting that he was a victim of false rape allegation. Mob killed the man because he was a Bengali and married a naga women. Gana people did not like it. Now his sister-in-law filed a false rape case on him because rape case is more stronger than 498a. The dead body sent to mother and father but the his naga-wife sitting in naga did not accept his husband's dead body. Feminist media is hiding all these information. He was not a rapist. He is a victim of a false rape accusation. It can happen to you as well anytime the what will you do? You don't have to rape anyone. India is not safe for man because of these legal terrorist on men
1838	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Protests in Assam because the rapists who got lynched was an illegal Bangladeshi muslim and not because he is a rapist !!!! Had this been a hindu rapists who got lynched then everyone TV news channeland its secular dog would have been screaming that justice has been served.
1839	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The latest news is that he was an Indian national who has family members who have served in the Indian Army. Wonder what the truth is.
1840	2015-03-08 00:00:00	can you paste the link (you make space while pasting link) or you heard over phone/T.V. Please validate .
1841	2015-03-08 00:00:00	the chaddi would die of heart attack after hearing that he is an indian citizen
1842	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because he wasn't rapist. Media is not reporting that he was a victim of false rape allegation. Mob killed the man because he was a Bengali and married a naga women.

1844	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I don't think anyone from my family will indulge in rape, as real men don't indulge in rapes, unlike you ISIS wallahs and the Nirbhaya scum
1845	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ur Father Chaddi babu Bajrangi , Kohli all are Rapist
1846	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes the illegal Bangladeshi Muslim whose brother fought for India and was martyred in kargil war.Not an opportunist like you who would give up his indian citizenship to have a better life in western country.Why even bother to comment to show that you are half indian or what.
1847	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You Chaddis have got your brain in ur azzz, Why  Babu bajrangi and kodnani not got lynched???  They were treied in the court.
1848	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You muzzie langotis have got your landus up your mom's ar$e
1849	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ur all illegimate sons of  Chaddi Babu bajrangi and co. Ask ur mom

1851	2015-03-08 00:00:00	are you pucking moron?
1852	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Here comes one squealing!
1853	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He is fi_Icking chaddi waala
1854	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes I pucked your wife, mom and sister when they were peddling their ar$e in Mangalore mandis
1855	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Your Mother, Wife, and Sister are all proud of your vocabulary and actions. Good boy.
1856	2015-03-08 00:00:00	you mean all the muslims are bangladeshi. And how do u know that this man was r u cbi?
1857	2015-03-08 00:00:00	OH No he is a chaddiwaala who has now gone to London to spread his chaddi knowledge.
1858	2015-03-08 00:00:00	very funny !!!
1859	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Not all muslims, but certainly majority of muslims in NE states like Assam are illegal Bongdeshis
1860	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You ARE stupid given your love of making seemingly factual statements based on nothing.
1861	2015-03-08 00:00:00	educated idiots like you are making india into pakistan very fast. Which developed country handles cases on the streets like this?
1862	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I will never say that this sort of mob justice is OK. But merely remarking that the protests seems to from one section of Assamese society, because the alleged rapists is from their community who has been killed. Had this been an alleged Hindu rapists who had been killed, you won't find Hindus protesting like this. Majority of the English media would be even finding a way to justify his killing in this fashion.
1863	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You sound like a dimwit who generalizes incorrectly. Mathematically, given the population distribution and shared culture, the odds are overwhelming that the majority of rapists are Hindu. Not that religion makes a difference, but I want to point out how stupid your comment is.
1864	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You are the dimmest wit here. I am not talking about the statistical distribution of rapists amongst the followers of various religions. Just the reaction of the muslim community to the killing of one of its member, by Nagas, who arw most likely to be Christians. They don't protest that one of their community member is a rapist allegedly, but protesting because he was killed, condoning his action that led to his death..
1865	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nagaland is Christian majority state... so lynching Muslim that too from the Jail is un pardonable crime.
1866	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Naga's need to launch an all out assault on all the Bengali muslims in Nagaland. Security forces should give a free hand to the people to save their women from future rapes. Free their land from aliens.
1867	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Typical UP waala bhaiyya....waise Bhaiyyaji how is ur grandfather Mulayam doing these days.
1868	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The hatred towards Illegal Bangladeshis perhaps "Mistakenly" took the life of an Indian Citizen!
1869	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Raping a Naga girl inspite of having a wife and being 35 years of ripe age, took this rapists life. When will you d uffers understand this simple truth and stop spreading falsehoods.
1870	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Report is still waiting.........
1871	2015-03-08 00:00:00	knock knock he was just an accused
1872	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Like Burma Army, Indian Army should start Bangladeshi cleansing operation in Northeast.We can't feed cockroaches food when our people are hungry.
1873	2015-03-08 00:00:00	son of soils. this is absolutely a protest in favour of rapists. the muslims always have a high birth rate problem. some families have 5 -7 kids. and put that eager into innocent girls of india. definitely it will not be tolerated. what protest you are doing all this protest should happen in bangladesh. muslims are the trouble maker. they need to forced removed. protest will happen all over the india. so what.? justice is made by people only. this rape case the muslims are trying to make it big. muslims will not be tolerate din india. no more diplomacy.
1874	2015-03-08 00:00:00	since he is a muslims, other muslims will support him even if is a rapist ... is it the teaching of islam?
1875	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Babu Bajrangi. Maya Kodnani have been lynched by such epitomes of justice that I would concede your point.
1876	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Amit don't blame Islam ? We cannot declare he was rapist until court decide.
1877	2015-03-08 00:00:00	wrong thinking...especially in india
1878	2015-03-08 00:00:00	islam in india are tending hindus. we are converting them. please Hinduism is way of living in india and we have been following it for ages. india is secular. muslims think it different way. they think they will increase population in india and take the country. but why we will allow that to happen ?
1879	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yes amit. its 100% correct in islam. they don't see the offence. they look only for the muslim peoples unity. weather it can be socially politically or any discrepancy for other religion. its an absolutely downgrade ideology.
1880	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what kind of a55 you are man
1881	2015-03-08 00:00:00	i am sorry. on ground reality you are not even eligible for 69
1882	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I think the protest should happen against these chaddi waalas who are busy instigating hatred among communities so as to earn some brownie points for there chaddi parties
1883	2015-03-08 00:00:00	BBC will now air a documentary on how Muslim rapists are mistreated in India.
1884	2015-03-08 00:00:00	One fails to understand why there is so much hue and cry for a Bangladeshi citizen who has committed such a heinous crime.
1885	2015-03-08 00:00:00	some people look educated but they are actually mentally sick, this person was from a family of Indian Army servicemen.
1886	2015-03-08 00:00:00	predictably the anti national muzies on this forum like to pretend this muzi rapist was only accused... which is far from truth... the girl clearly mentioned this guy in her report.. there was forensic evidence collected.. there were witness accounts .. there is no indication of any other guy involved.. this guy was the rapist.... not just someone innocently accused... the victim is the girl not this much married muzi rapist.. !!!
1887	2015-03-08 00:00:00	whatever court will decide Hindu terrorists will not decide
1888	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The Khangress/CONgress Govt  in Assam survives only on the illegal Bangladeshi muslim vote bank and hence they are making a big issue out of it.  These Bangladeshis have been illegality granted citizenship for the sake of votes.  The Central Govt should investigate the matter and revoke all the citizenship.
1889	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes, absolutely right you are.
1890	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bangladeshis should be thrown out from and neighboring states of Nagaland.
1891	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He was lynched because he is a Muslim, not because he was rape accused. I hold Modi, Bhagwat, Rajnath responsible. They have created environment that is hostile to the Muslim and Christian minority.
1892	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Check all ID Papers of all Assamnese.  If they are illegally migrated to Assam, deport them.
1893	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The disease called Islam is far more destructive than lust.
1894	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because the rapist is a cruel Muslim....................all secular anti-India people are out to protect a criminal...........................................
1895	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sudhir how can u say he was rapist? Did he rape your sister.
1896	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bangla muslums have no right to protest as they are not indian citizens.
1897	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Congress is encouraging the Bangladeshi's in Assam to attack Naga's. It's want's bloodshed.
1898	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why muslims are so obssessed with conspiracy theories.  Let it put up things straight.  He was a rape accused and was arrested for same by police. Mob in india often lynch rapist and thief its not a new thing. Just because he is a muslim all this nonsense is being going on. And muslism should stop this hypocrisy of protest for a rape accused.  Had a hindu have been lynched insted of him than there would have been no drama of this short. even in islam a rape accused is granted  death by stoning so in short justice was done move on.
1899	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What can we expect with laws having so many loop holes. What ever has happened may be wrong according to law but it would be nice to learn unity shown by Nagas and understand the system needs improvement. By the way what was BangladeshI  doing in India. We also need extra efforts to bring people of Nagaland in confidence that central government stands by them.
1900	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yeh ek mulla bangladeshi rapist tha...isko leke itna drama kyun? Maaro in kutto ko jahan mile wahan....
1901	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why such protests in Assam for killing a r0pist?? Does it mean killing some one from their community for such an attempt is wrong?? The punishment is right, looking at the law in India, this suits such cases much better and can bring down rates of such acts, much better than the useless laws, which protests the convicts.
1902	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what a country where only minority people are killed without being proved guilty ,but whenever a person like srabjeet who were found guilty of bomb blast and were convicted by court were killed indside the jail permises in the sàme fashion then every body start shouting that it is injustice and it was but  tris time sàme govt sàme people are trying to justify this act ,i am unable to undestand that what type polluted blood these people r having,bcz if some body has done some thing wrong then only law can punish them but in india its not happens ,its worst situation than any country in the world ,bcz no law for all the people who r not following hinduism some time Church are burnt some time people are burnt alive by these people but there is no law for there survival they are torcherd there propety are captured from the time  when Bjp start rulling the nation so whats the difference between boko hram and govt of india whoe is indirectly allowing this type of moral less activity ,so i am thinking the difference between  boko   hraam which  is terrorist organisation  and  governa of india which  is democratically elected
1903	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Very bitter but so true !  Common sense is getting so uncommon and emotions are replacing wisdom.
1904	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A REQUIEM FOR JYOTHI SINGH "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!
1905	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The blame is of Indian judiciary which takes years to punish a guilty. People are losing faith in it. This is the fitting example of it. Another thing which I can't understand here is why people are protesting in support of a rapist. it doesn't matter who he is or where he comes from. A rapist is a rapist regardless of his country or religion.
1906	2015-03-08 00:00:00	2nd paragraph of this report is incomplete. Complete sentence shall be - "Nagaland Police have arrested 18 people in connection with the lynching" of a RAPIST. Everybody is telling - "The killing of Syed Farid Khan, a Dimapur based businessman from Assam, is an inhuman act". My question is raping a lady is not an "inhuman act"? Why there is no protest against rape???!!!  Patience of public has reached its extreme level. Nagaland shows way to entire nation. Governments must wake up and take urgent action in improving our judiciary system. Security forces can control 2000. But can they control 2 million?
1907	2015-03-09 00:00:00	yes they can most of mob people know that when they do crime in mob they will not be arrested, so police should arrest all people who are in front so rest will dont dare take law into hand
1908	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why not any other naga killed for rape or murder in similar way? and who will prove rape mob or judiciary
1909	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Once again, read my 2nd paragraph. Answer to your question is already given there.
1910	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nobody is saying rapists should not be punished. However we do not need a jungle law where popular opinion and not a fair trial shall decide who is guilty and what is punishment.
1911	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Read my 2nd paragraph. Answer to your question is already given there.
1912	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He was a Bangladeshi.
1913	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Govt should start deporting all Bangladeshi Muslims out of northeast.Congress,TMC have made these pigs A VVIP
1914	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist getting grand funeral in Assam,MLA and MPs visiting his family.He died as a martyr despite the rapist a illegal bangladeshi . He shouldn't be killed as he was Muslim ! The main culprit of Delhi rape was a Muslim conductor who called the victim to Bus. He got let free by Cong govt because he was a Muslim for vote bank. His age was deliberately shown less than 18 years to protect him.
1915	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So called rapist's who you call Bangladeshi, his  father was in IAF and brother died as a Kargil martyr. Some Bangladeshi.
1916	2015-03-08 00:00:00	1st) it's not worth it to take law in our hands. 2nd) he was accused not acquitted of rape. 3rd)he was an Indian citizen not an alien.
1917	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The saffron chaddi would not understand basic facts..they are all filled with hatred and anarchy.
1918	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sickular muzzies supporting rapists -- will u do same if it happens ur sister/daughter/family member ?????? Sharia says punish him ,, u say support him - ??
1919	2015-03-08 00:00:00	no one supporting rape, but some Hindu terrorists supporting killing by mob
1920	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I salute the courageous mob who dragged a rapist from police and killed because the law in this country is with rapists.  Such incidents should happen to every rapists and then no one will even dare to do it.  It is a warning to corrupt Police and toothless Judiciary as they are just sympathisers of rapists and criminal.
1921	2015-03-08 00:00:00	May  be you would not think so if it was one of your kin &amp; kith who was accused and than mob tried and executed. Brother law has to take its course and if law is not the way you like it or if it is not functioning that can be changed by legislation. Kangaroo courts are no alternative to legal courts.
1922	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Political backing is there.
1923	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Vegetarians deciding which meat Non-vegetarians should eat... Bachelors deciding how many kids women should produce... Straights deciding on limits of gay lovemaking... Actors commenting on Medical ethics... Doctors commenting on Vedic Astrology... Politicians deciding which films should be released this Friday... Clerics and Pujaris debating on how much science is OK for schools... "Half-pant" wearing uncles deciding on teenager girls' skirt length... Rapists commenting on the morality of girls they rape and murder... India... Indeed...
1924	2015-03-09 00:00:00	ha ha ha ha... that's the irony... isn't it??
1925	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is time to put a strong action against communal forces.
1926	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Karimganj can not be his "native" village. It was widely reported that this r*pist was an illegal Bangladeshi migrant. Now, true Indians are arrested. Why BDs are not evicted from India ? Why there are little "Pakistans" all over India ? Why Muslims are in India after getting Pakistan ?
1927	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why the hell this media house is behaving like a spokesperson of a rapist just because he is sicular muslim. And had this reporter had seen the medical report of victim if not than why there is one sided story.
1928	2015-03-08 00:00:00	3 million Bangladeshs imported as vote bank for Congress and local parties over a period of last 30 years. Election card for free. Ration card for Rs 200. Adhar card still not known. Bodos forced to take up arms against imported vote bank. Whole of Nort east is in a mess. Hope this time Modi can do something good.
1929	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bodo and naga are very strong fighters,Govt should arm them,they alone are able to deport all these pigs to heaven
1930	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims need to be beheaded,they are curse for world
1931	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is sheer madness.Nagaland people  have shown great courage in lynching the rapist in public so as to teach all the rapists of the country a lesson and the Govt wants courts to deliver justice which may take another 20 years or more and who will believe the stupid courts in India which are crawling like a snail in disposing the cases.
1932	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This fire of Communal hatred has been lit by RSS, VHP, Hindu Mahasabha and by Amit Shah.
1933	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The Medical Examination of the Girl Proved to be Negative. There is a Deep Rooted Conspiracy in the Victims Dearh.

1934	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist should get punished. Bangladeshis are not welcome in Hindustan. We in IndiA got too much democracy for outsiders and politicians.
1935	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I dont understand why there is so much roar in killing a rapist ...because he is a muslim ..now the muslims got to know that it  is not safe to mess with nagas
1936	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Release those inocent people our system of justice would take 20 yrs and could not get the culprit to books. This is the peoples anger which the govt does not understand.
1937	2015-03-08 00:00:00	swift punishment is needed for such crime, though it should not be mob punishment. muslim are not native of Nagaland. If they want to live there, respect culture and law of that land. Dont infest it with your culture.
1938	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Aryan Hindus are also not native of India
1939	2015-03-08 00:00:00	medical report confirm rape but our beloved(hated politicians) shouting that rape haven't happen!! including cm of Nagaland, how come he come to know rape doesn't happen?  all Muslims leaders and human activities( inhuman)  on the road to safeguard criminal??! great Indian politics.
1940	2015-03-08 00:00:00	rape happens or not you should not decide nor you should punish
1941	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims used rape as a weapon &amp; it's their religious duty to convert as many kafirs as possible just like other nasty things mentioned in their holy books. That's why wise people advised Muslims to live separately from other civilized religions but for the Congress party.
1942	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Congress state Govt in Assam has made Assam a safe home for immigrant criminals.
1943	2015-03-08 00:00:00	*  WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her poor ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished ans much yearned dream Yet you made sure she never bagged even that humble dream! Going to a movie with a kith when the night was still tender Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so good and tender Her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat Instead of bedecking her bridal chamber with blooms most fragrant and bright, sod! And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry loud and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-smeared parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream, sod! Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that agony-torn mummy Will scorch the earth? And you never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so sub-human to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains embedded in the intellect; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Heven is only a place on earth; you know not? Why you didn't  really know that even I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not Mind! But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you hear it or take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Unscrupulous hypocrite and stealer of all human happiness, was it too much to ask for?

1945	2015-03-08 00:00:00	punishing the rapist , including death penalty was the work of law, especially when he was locked up. the mobsters should now be punished for murder, and by another mob , but by law only. mob justice is mostly the result of conspiracy and instigation , and is seldom near to truth.
1946	2015-03-08 00:00:00	True indeed !
1947	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The way terrorist is only a terrorist a rapist is only a rapist irrespective of his religion caste class color creed region reservation etc so India has to make very very hard laws for rapes murders &amp; corruption cases as our olden days laws are not capable to control these matters so Government of India should do something drastically if they don't do anything for avoiding &amp; stopping such matters you take it that Government of India is not exercising democracy but a government of hypocrisy &amp; mockery as sometimes their own relatives are involved in such scams scandals rapes murders corruption etc.
1948	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If justice is denies this is what going to happen. people will take law and order in their hands. judiciary/Police and executive better wake up. Check the cases and people will be kept in jail for long even after death sentence awarded and after some time say that he/she has already served the minimum jail term so convert death to live imprisonment.
1949	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What was security &amp; police personnel were doing  when the mob took out the victim from high security jail &amp; lynched him May be just because he was a Non Naga Dismiss natal and govt. immediately. Ridiculous  Samir
1950	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Some bloody sick minded saying why did that protest bcoz he was Muslim,   I say Yes. We all are Muslims with him. He was a martyr. who the hell was mob to beat him till date bcoz he was Muslim , nirbhya gang rapist is enjoying biryani and giving interview. why don't all sick minded go to rapist of nirbhya and hang him in jail. I know that no one will go bcoz they are hindus
1951	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The land where Rapists get a grand funeral..
1952	2015-03-09 00:00:00	NEW DELHI: Protests rocked Assam, especially in the three districts in the Barack Valley in the state, following the lynching of a rape accused in Nagaland's Dimpaur town on March 5.  Nagaland Police have arrested 18 people in connection with the lynching.  The arrests were made since last evening after going through the mobile video clippings during the incident and their interrogation is on, they said.  The victim Syed Farid Khan, who was dragged out of jail and beaten to death, was buried at his native village in Karimganj amidst tight security on Sunday.  Khan was buried in Karimganj's Bosla village. A huge turnout was reported with former minister and Karimganj (south) MLA Siddeque Ahmed attending, Karimganj deputy commissioner Sanjiv Gohain Boruah said. RIP
1953	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I lay the blame on Modi, BJP, RSS, Mohan Bhagwat, Shah and the communal leaders for creating an environment of "Hostility" and "Abomination" towards the Muslim Minorities. They are all legally culpable.
1954	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Then who should be blamed for comments by your Muslim friends saying Rape of Non Muslims legal. You???
1955	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If you believe that is true, then you should discuss with some Muslim Scholar and find the reasons. The violence against Women and Minorities in India is inspired by the bigotry of Modi, BJP, Mohan Bhagwat, RSS, VHP and many low IQ leaders like them. Do you agree with me? I guess so!
1956	2015-03-09 00:00:00	56 HINDUS KILLED IN GODRA. MANY BEING SUBJECTED TO VIOLENCE IN KERALA. MANY TEMPLES BEING RAVAGED. (NUMBER OF TEMPLES BEING RAVAGED ARE MORE THAN THAT OF OTHER RELIGIOUS SHRINES). YOU STILL SAY MINORITIES ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO VIOLENCE? OPEN COMMENTS WITH THE STATEMENTS SAYING THAT IT IS LEGAL IN ISLAM TO RAPE NON BELIEVERS ARE COMMING WHICH ARE ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE SO CALLED MAJORITIES AND YOU SAY MINORITIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VIOLENCE? WHAT YOU SAID THAT MINORITIES ARE SUBJECTED TO VIOLENCE BY THE BIGOTRY OF BJP AND RSS IS ONLY JUST A MINORITY CARD BEING PLAYED BY YOUR KIND. MINORITY CARD HAS A GOOD POWER FOR THOSE WHO COMMITED VIOLENCE TO GO FREE AND YOU PEOPLE ENCOURAGE IT.
1957	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I believe Minorities in India, Muslims, Christians and Sikhs are under tremendous stress from Right Wing Hinduists, even most state governments are partial and biased, almost all Judiciary is biased against the minorities. For example; How Many Hindus were prosecuted and Punished for the Massacre of Sikhs, which according to GOI, 3300 Sikhs were killed, according to Sikhs 20,000 were killed. I believe Mob Violence, Mob Terrorism is a particular Hindu modus operandi and they use their numbers to terrorize the Minorities.
1958	2015-03-09 00:00:00	YOU BELIEVE!!!! IF YOU ARE SITTING IN AMERICA OR IN YOUR HOUSE IN A CLOSED ROOM, THEN YES YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE SITUATION. ITS NOT THE MINORITIES UNDER PRESSURE. ITS ONLY THE MAJORITY HINDUS UNDER PRESSURE AND THIS HAPPENS ONLY IN INDIA. THE STATS WHICH YOU PRESENT I DONT KNOW ARE STARTING FROM WHICH YEAR I DONT KNOW. BUT IF HISTORY IS CONSIDERED, MILLIONS OF HINDUS ARE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THIS IS CONTINUING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IN INDIA FROM SOUTHERN MOST STATE KERALA TO NORTH EASTERN STATES AND NORTHERN STATES. HOW MANY PANDITS ARE KILLED? HOW MANY OF THEM DISPLACED FROM THEIR RIGHTEOUS PLACE? HOW MANY ARE LIVING AS REFUGEES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY? HOW MANY IN BENGAL KILLED? IN KERALA RECENT INCIDENT IS HINDUS ARE BEATEN FOR CELEBRATING HOLI. COUPLE OF HINDUS ARE KILLED IN ASSAM FOR TRYING TO CONVERT TO HINDU RELIGION. WHO IS CARRYING OUR CRUSADER WARS AND JIHAD IN THE NAME OF RELIGION? EVEN AFTER SEEING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO ACCEPT THE SUFFERING OF MAJORITY UNDER THE VIOLENT MINORITIES, THEN I SHOULD SAY YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WITH SEPARATIST AGENDA FROM THE WEST WHO IS TRYING TO BREAK MY COUNTRY IN THE NAME OF RELIGION. ONE MORE THING IS THAT "A LIE IF REPEATED 100 TIMES WILL BE ACCEPTED AS A FACT". &amp; THIS IS WHAT THE YOU PEOPLE DO ALONG WITH PLAYING MINORITY CARD.
1959	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No one is above LAW and no one can take law in their hands , People who are involved in killing should be severely punished
1960	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Good riddance. I wish there are more mob attacks against muslims and the community is wiped out from India.
1961	2015-03-09 00:00:00	WHY nobody are asking the cause of delay is Indian Justice system. Hundreds of thousands cases are pending. Is is common to see cases pending for 5, 10, 15, 20 years even more. WHY? Who should answe this question. Who are responsible for running of Courts System? The Supreme Court Justices, are they dummies? in recent time, it is observed that only Political cases arr getting timely clearrd by Supreme Court. All Media Houses are spineless on this subject. Justice delayed is justice denied, it has no meaning in the country's Justice System. Until the Justice System is over-hauled and Reformed, India will continue to remain as a HANDICAPPED DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.
1962	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SHlTHole India will remain the same dark dysfunctional mess forever!  India is the Rape capital of the world.  There are thousands of the rapes being committed everyday in this hell-hole but the saffron primitives do not break in to the jails everyday to kill the alleged rapists.  But here the alleged is a Muslim by name and the saffron primitives did what they are always good at, they staged yet another drama to kill yet another Indian who is a Muslim by name.
1963	2015-03-09 00:00:00	once you kill, you bcm a convict of culpable homicide. And ppl who are still claiming that it was right to kill the accused, I wud ask them to open a dictionary and look up the differences between "accused" and "convict" before commenting here. If today any random girl says that you raped her, then you automatically bcm an accused person. If you want yourself to b lynched for that without proving urself then you may write in pleasure "justice was done" or else shut your pieh0les
1964	2015-03-09 00:00:00	if guilty, he got what he deserved as per Sharia law. Sorry for is  mother. ...
1965	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Looks like the Assam govt is just trying to gain political benefits out of this incident ahead of the state election which will be held sometime in the next year. A criminal is just a criminal - does not matter which place he belongs to. I do not see any point of making uproar by the govt of Assam in it.
1966	2015-03-09 00:00:00	There should be some limit of discrimination and prejudicial view against a particular people as a result of which Farid Khan being dubbed as Bangladeshi becomes liable to be lynched inhumanely and savagely on the pretext of a crime yet to be proved. What a shame that for targeting a Muslim by anybody, it is enough to name him Bangladeshi and law remains spectator! Fie upon such law and society.
1967	2015-03-09 00:00:00	yes all rape accused must be lynched .
1968	2015-03-09 00:00:00	300 rapes in delhi regiin in last 2 months.....shouldnt we lynch all...???
1969	2015-03-09 00:00:00	if it is so we must lynch NIRBHAYA accused too....and hundreds of more.....who has given right to public to take law and order in its hand..!!
1970	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why this much action when a rapist is killed? should a biriyani be served to him for an achievement by keeping him alive?
1971	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Rape in mainland India: Rape victim is shamed, rapists roam free or are bailed, no of rape cases escalating. Nagaland: People fight for rape victim, rapist lynched and I reckon there won't be any rape cases here anymore.
1972	2015-03-08 00:00:00	you do not want to discuss and claim a ful stop but before that say Europeans do that for another reason! So European r2ping a girl is for decent reasons and not as bad as brown Man doing it? lol. do you worship white skin? Anycase, yes I am sure of my figures. In fact in countries like Sweden it is more than 20 times on per capita basis to India. Even after taking into account underreporting India has 5 times less r2pe than most western countries, that is a very high estimate of underreporting. No one has suggested less than 50% r2pe get reported in India, find me a source that says that. 30% women in America get r2ped, look around you in India it is nowhere that high. It may have a lot to do with traditional societies, in uch societies dis6gust with r2pe ND HONOR of women is so sacrosanct for families that such things are not dared by most.,
1973	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The Nagland government has imposed a 48-hour internet blackout in the state beginning last night after videos related to the lynching of the rape accused in Dimapur surfaced on the net.
1974	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is sad what has happened, in India it is easy to accuse any man of rape to put him in trouble, if the medical report  says no sexual abuse why was this man killed, It is becoming a trend to blackmail or accuse a man of rape.
1975	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Whatever be the reason. Killing must not go unpunished. Let it not become a trend setter.
1976	2015-03-08 00:00:00	SO NOW RAPING IS BEING LEGALISED IN INDIA??? I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN SOON... THANKS TO OUR INDIAN LAWS WHICH LETS RAPING A EASIER DAY BY DAY
1977	2015-03-08 00:00:00	dont know if it is wrong or right what the protesters did, people have lost faith in the judiciary system
1978	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lets be cautious.....Democracy is threatening our nation!!! It's has given more liberty to outsiders..... Let's think over it!!! ??Democracy was adopted with good intentions.!!!But we need to think over it... at least for our nation!!! let's forget ourselves!!!! :@
1979	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The hypocrisy of rape is at its peak in India..
1980	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No word to express the extreme brutality of Nagaland lynching. Also the betrayal by unclothing those, who  once have taught them as how to cover the nudity and shown the light of the civilized world. Discovery Channel, instead of going into the deep forest  may cover these areas and prove that beasts are more comparable. Let the bogus associations that prevail in the state not shout against anything that they can not define. Do these associations know drugs, rape etc. better learn as how to control own children first. Live  a life of a civilized world with honesty.
1981	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is really surprising that mob could go inside a high security jail take out a man and lynch him in the presence of security &amp; police personnel. Is it possible without help from admin. since the victim is a Non Naga. Dismiss this govt. at once just dismissing few officers not enough.  Samir M
1982	2015-03-08 00:00:00	These protestors should now go to Delhi and do the same with the Nirbhaya rapists and their defense lawyer. Ordinarily such actions are not  to supported. But in India, lawlessness has reached to such an extent that the population is fed up and have decided to take action in their own hands. Some politicians who are supporting anti-socials should also be dealt with the same treatment. French revolution started with ordinary people.
1983	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist should be killed like this..
1984	2015-03-08 00:00:00	To my all Indian Muslims and all Indian friends. Today I read a news of Saudi Arabia. One Woman jailed and got 70 lashes and waiting to get another 200 lashes. What is her crime?? She got rap&amp;ed by 7 people. She tried to told that story to media, this is her crime. The first 70 lashes is because she went in a car with another person other than her husband for some urgent work. The person took her to a place, where 7 more people waited and all they ra&amp;ped her. Because all those people knew, if she told this to anyone, it will be her fault. Unfortunately she could not keep quite, and told her story to media. Then Saudi Police came and arrest her. Now this is her fate in Muslim country.
1985	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The biggest worry is that everywhere around the world locals are hating aroubian cultural converts.
1986	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dont know why people are calling him rapist when news has given that female had charged him falsely and her allegations were medically incorrect Now what should be done to female putting false charges
1987	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I read a news about a Hindu man convicted for life term for raping his own mother several times.....but not even a single person was accusing Hindu community
1988	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hope this ugly incident puts some element of fear in the minds of prospective rapists which our judicial system was incapable of!
1989	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Today Nirbhaya's convict is still enjoying his days in jail, he has no shame of what crime he has done, What Nagaland public has done is justifiable
1990	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dont know why people are calling him rapist when news has given that female had charged him falsely and her allegations were medically incorrect . If such is the case what should be done to her
1991	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Authority should treat this case like Nirbhaya case, not otherwise. General observations:- When accused is happened to be minority, Govt (irrespective of the party in power) authority takes back step and hesitant to move forward. Jai Hind.
1992	2015-03-08 00:00:00	neither the rape was confirmed nor the accused belongs to bangladesh..but still heinous activity.these all  will continue until bjp is thrown from centre..
1993	2015-03-08 00:00:00	one  rapist is asaram bapu who is enjoying all luxury of life in jail only bcz he is hindu regious babà ,and one is killed in asam bcz he is muslim not Just a repist  but if he has done this then punishment is excellent and any muslim who is commiting this crime should be punishded in sàme fashion bcz islam tells the sàme punishment and all hindu religeous leader should be made free to rape any woman bcz in hinduism raping right is given to aall hindu babas who dont marry but only rape women on the name of religion and asaram bapu is best èxample
1994	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What a grand funeral to RAPIST ,infact his body must have thrown to be eaten by animals and then criminal will have lesson from it.Shame on Politcian or it is another vote grabbing tectic
1995	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I held from Assam!!! I felt pathetic as these Muslim r support ing the rapist!! wait n see assamese society for these pigs Wat they to us after 15 year
1996	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist , a 28 year old rich bangla muslim businessman  is getting sympathy, attention  , and support The poor victim , a 25 year old naga girl has been forgotten Why ? Just because he   is from a protected community --muslim though a bangla illegal migrant Does being sickular means even supporting rapists    .? Rape was being touted a heinous crime but when confronted with muslim appeasement looses hands down
1997	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Here Indian Govt more anxious to protect the criminals then the victim.What has to be done by Govt ,public has done in ONE day. Change all the laws of 200 yrs old and change the complete constitution to modern day of India. Any criminal cannot contest the election or hold any Post then you will see the changes in the system.
1998	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Was some latest You Tube... accessible in such vulnerable areas... ?? GOK
1999	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NE is a sensitive area... hope some past bitter episodes won't be allowed to happen... govts. intel agencies, armed forces, police shall work in tandem.. to be on top vigil and utmost alert... ? GOK
2000	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is how each &amp; every Muslims should be beaten to Death.
2001	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yep, we are less one rapist. Instead of being happy the government is tense because he was Muslim. I don't see BJP any different from Congress. BJP days are also numbered now. Delhi election already showed them the doors.
2002	2015-03-08 00:00:00	These protestors should now go to Delhi and do the same with the Nirbhaya rapists and their defense lawyer. Ordinarily such actions are not  to supported. But in India, lawlessness has reached to such an extent that the population is fed up and have decided to take action in their own hands.
2003	2015-03-08 00:00:00	How come there is no reaction to rape? But protests to protect the rapists?? This is a demented society and we proclaim culture and sh1t..
2004	2015-03-08 00:00:00	rascism must be dealt with strongly.
2005	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Fellow mulla pigs are portraying this secular rapist as Martyr.Govt should give this Bangladeshi a Bharat Ratna
2006	2015-03-08 00:00:00	WOW REALLY AMAZED TO SEE AN INDIAN THAT TOO A CM OF A STATE SUPPORT AN ILLEGAL BHANGLADESHI IMMIGRANT WHO HAS COMMITTED A GRAVE CRIME OF RAPE AS MEDICAL REPORTS CONFRIM THE SAME. LOOKS LIKE GOGO IS SPOKES PERSON FOR BHANGLADESH . CONGRESS SINKING PARTY WAKE UP AND STOP THIS MAN FROM SUPPORTING ILLEGAL BHANGLADESHIS
2007	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What these trolls here are going to do about the fellow who inserted a TMT rod inside a small girl in ahmedabad. He is sure human?
2008	2015-03-08 00:00:00	We all read,saw the news about him being down to death but what about hapless woman who was raped, which organisation or govt.enquiry could bring back her lost honour,shattered future?It seems that nation only recognise the offenders caste or community then sympathy game starts,another shameful aspect of ours.
2009	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It's natural for an unruly mob to be harsh on a rapist.Day by day the case is detoriorating ,but on the part of the mob it was a shameful act.They could have waited till medical reports but at the same time law cannot be taken on our own hands.This heinous situation arose as rape cases have become such prevalent all over India that even there is a slightest allegation on a man,even if he actually didn't commit it,he is bound to face harsh action from the angry mob.
2010	2015-03-08 00:00:00	BJP are masters of taking the law into their hands. Modi himself accused of that.
2011	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Another communal riot in the making??? Qre these guys who are protestimg from bangaladesh?
2012	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I condemn this lynching. Due process should be given. Rape is a serious crime. Police must act promptly.
2013	2015-03-08 00:00:00	true justice happened with the rapist...that should be happen with all the rspist
2014	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sir how can you be so sure, without a trial and conviction ? This is very dangerous trend that can lead to breakdown of social order. Today it is a rapist, tomorrow it will be a pickpocket then may be a liar and then may be an alleged sinner. Mob rule is misrule.

If I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings.

2018	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ALL INDIANS MUST SWEAR TO SEND ALL BANGLADESHI MUSLIM TO BANGLADESH LIKE BURMA. RAPIDEST MUST BE HANGED.
2019	2015-03-08 00:00:00	BHANGLADESH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT RAPES INDIAN WOMEN AND THERE IS SOLIDARITY IN ASSAM WOW I WONDER WHERE OUR COUNTRY IS HEADING TO
2020	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I am sorry it has nothing to with religion or country. A woman is a woman who should not have been raped. A suspect (innocent until proven guilty) has been lynched, which should not have happened either. I don't know if you feel differently if an indian man rapes an illegal Bangladeshi woman. But i still feel that both the woman and the man should have to follow the due course of law.
2021	2015-03-08 00:00:00	mob justice is always painful,
2022	2015-03-08 00:00:00	And often wrong. Remember Taliban in Afghanistan ?
2023	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Goverment officials are sitting only to take free salary i guess angry mob took the guy from jail what a shame to the police.....without trail people convicted the rapist &amp; killed him.....
2024	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If he has really the culprit then what is wrong in lynching him? But if he is innocent then the repercussions are too high and it is against any kind of justice.
2025	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sir i think we have laws and lynching is not a legal dispensation for convicts.
2026	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Yes Sir, we have laws but who cares for them. Cases go for 20, 30 years and finally many of the witness, culprits, police officers die of natural death and the cases get dismissed. Indian courts and police delay in almost all cases.
2027	2015-03-08 00:00:00	But story wud have been different if the culprit wud have been a tribal or someone from different tribes among nagas. Only because the person was a outsider they had shown their courage. Being a bangladeshi or illigal migrant is not a critria. These ppl are racist and they dont like non nagas. Myself being born n brought up frm this place have witnessed such things and its still carrying on.
2028	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A good point to ponder indeed.
2029	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The test report has proved the rape. so the criminal got his due, period!
2030	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A REQUIEM FOR JYOTHI SINGH "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Jyothi and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!
2031	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its horrible, surprise that in  Assam a group of people rise in support of a rapist. The religious bond surpassed feeling of crime against a helpless woman. Rape &amp; Mob lynch both are wrong, both be condemned.
2032	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Secular rapist.
2033	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dear you do not spoil your moth by saying bad words, just pray for them.
2034	2015-03-08 00:00:00	actually involvement of jail admn. must be inquired...
2035	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hmmmm
2036	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Is he an Indian or an emigrant as reported earlier? The punishment was right.....
2037	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Looks like Nagaland has become a part of Islamic State !!!!
2038	2015-03-08 00:00:00	India maybe heading for disintigration under bjp.
2039	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mulloon ko kaaat do

2041	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslim men have the right to rape Hindu women, this has been going on for past 1000 years, why is the a front page story?
2042	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Stop bringing religion into it. By the way I hope you know that Nagas are mostly Christians.
2043	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Where did I say anything about the religion of victim?
2044	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If ten thousand people were involved in punishing the guy, there is something there. It could be the girl might have told all what happened or it could be case of repeated offence by outsiders. Government should see and assure people by taking some positive actions. Arresting people and punish them will amplify more such incident in future.
2045	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is just the way riots happen, based on misinformation and non application of mind.
2046	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Here I want to report something that had happened in Delhi. One of my friends was going with another friend in a car in Delhi (both males).  A woman asked for lift and said  her son is sick and she needs to reach him quickly and the buses take time. My friend has decided to give her a lift (he is married and also has a kid). She got off and went straight to police station and reported that they raped her. Police came to my friend and  filed an FIR and arrested him. He was released on bail and then started inquiry into this woman. She had done this before and has filed complaints on 15 more people. Being Indian Police (sorry a generalization), they started harassing my friend for money and favors. it went on and on until he was exonerated. The messages are the following 1. Be very careful when you want to help someone by given them ride in your car. Think of the worst possible consequences. 2. If mob reacted to this and lynched my friend then justice is not served at all. We have laws for a reason and no one should take them into hands. I am strongly in favor of castrating the rape criminal after courts have convicted them. But killing them out of public anger is not good and does not reflect on a civilized society. Lets have the laws to castrate the rape criminals and start a petition online to the Govt.
2047	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Seems collateral damage. When too many illegals cross to some states and they want to stop you from doing that...rather than punishing an accused rapist. May be people's lack of belief in justice system adds to this.
2048	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rape should be reported as major head lines but not as this new paper is reporting, there have been 300 rapes in two months.  This is the true face off the people off New Delhi and the politicians’ and the Hindu Sodus, Those who encourage Rape should be sent to prison. The law in New Delhi regarding Rape has completely broken down.  The Indian press are not making the Rape has a major issue, small head lines. I have said before the BJP got elected that crime will rise also the Indian inflation will go up, give 2 more month. The Man off New Delhi should made to marry a cow because you have more respect for the caws and nil for the daughters and the sisters India. There are some good people in New Delhi who will go out on the street and protest, the Government must get a rape prevention program and a Nation wide protests will also help this case. prem
2049	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Forgive and forget should be the motto for all in such circumstances to defuse the tension. Politicians and Assamese people are going wrong way. Their politics and behavior will aggravate the situation. As J&amp;K Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed is giving amnesty to co-religious terrorists and anti-national, in the same manner in this case to amnesty should be given to those who are involved in this lynching for larger peace and harmony. Some vested groups are trying to fan communal riots using this lynching.
2050	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Death penalty should be given to rapists   but not until the case against him his proved...
2051	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If at all the medical report shows that the girl was not at all raped as stated by the brother of the accused and as stated in some sections of the press, then it is an unfortunate inhuman communal act and the people responsible must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law and exemplary punishment must be given to them.
2052	2015-03-08 00:00:00	We need stricter more drastic laws for rape!!!! In maharashtra, a person gets more jail for eating beef but less for rape. It is beyond stupidity.
2053	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What was the dirty muslim mla doing at the burial? These dirty muslim politicians only want votes from illegal immigrants. Where did all the muslims in NE come from? Who are these people agitating in Assam? Who the truck drivers protesting?
2054	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Genuinely even I would feel that those protesting the killing of the rapist should be warned off sternly. But if it was not a Rape and the medical report of the girl doesn't prove the rape then an innocent has got killed which is wrong. I am pretty sure no one would want to see someone close to you meet the same fate if he has been falsely framed in any criminal case. Anyway, Frankly speaking if he did rape (though we are democracy and he should have got a proper court hearing), what the mob did was the best thing. This should be spread across India as Wildfire. So that rapists get the fear of Mob fury. That might reduce rapes to some  extent. Not a complete solution unless the mindset of Men changes all over. But When Men don't seem to have any fear of what they are doing, there will be no way any government will be able to stop crimes against women. Our Govt has banned the Documentary film on Nirbhaya purely because they believe it will Affect tourist inflow from Abroad. Tourism in India has grown 1200 times since our PM declared the world over for Visa on Arrival facility(We don't get it when we go but they get when they come). The Government basically seems to have accepted that crimes against women are a common thing and happens world over but highlighting it for India means it will affect the Tourist inflow and the FDI inflow the economy has started to get. A simple process of setting up CCTV cameras in at least major cities first and hiring personal to monitor them can go a great way in reducing crimes overall. The Government should use the money from Tourist inflow for Setting up security Cameras across major destinations and cities in India. Without all these measures, We will keep hearing more such rape and crime stories. Media will keep highlighting some one or two incidents and nothing will change except for the governments. It's time to act. Set up CCTV Cameras across all Traffic Signals and tourist spots in India first. Then Near Hotels and key junction points on Highways. ACTION is required from the government Please !

2057	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Govt should realize that if Bangladeshi come into country like, such problems will rise. STOP illegal immigration!!!
2058	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lynching isnt the answer.. Look at the after effect, hailed as a victim whose funeral is attended by high and mighty.. There is a reason why law should take its own course.. though rape cases should be tried immediately and capital punishment awarded if proved. There should be no adjournments
2059	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Government medical report clearly says Naga lady was raped... still these people wants to make him a hero..and calling him "shaheed"
2060	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bangladeshi muslim immigrants are responsible for most of the serious crimes in the north east/west bengal. They should be kicked out of India as soon as possible
2061	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bangladeshi Pu sslims are destoying Indian and look at their audacity...calling for bandh... CONgress has foked my country up...India can only be Developed when there are no Muslims in it...
2062	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If he is a genuine Bengali Indian Muslim, identifying one from out of a million Bangladeshis is not easy, especially if a mob is baying for his blood. Even if he is a Bangladeshi, we can't condone vigilante justice. BUT, before saying that vigilante justice is wrong, we need to understand that vigilante justice takes place only if there is no confidence on the government machinery. And here, we see police virtually opening the doors to the mob. So, what went wrong?
2063	2015-03-08 00:00:00	its very unfortunate that people taken low in their hand but.... if low not given them justice or take long time to get justice in rape case... the anger comes out and that kind of result take place........ they did right action with rapist .... but as democratic country it will accepted...
2064	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims- you should be happy in a way because the Nagas actually meted out Sharia style of public exection And you all really know that your beloved brothers are actually rapists, dont you? especially of non Muslim girls. so pls dont drab the boring statement that he was just accused and not convicted just like how you do everytime one of your brothers are caught. Hindus - 2 reasons to be happy 1) it will provide a wake up call to our system to speed up the process of justice 2) one potential terrorist less  Nagas - thank you for paying the Muslims back in their own coin of Sharia law. they really cant complain. but yes they will keep saying that their beloved brother was just accused
2065	2015-03-08 00:00:00	All criminals must be punished but only as per legal procedure. We are a democratic nation with well established institutions. India is still a nation in building process, and such events are regressive for a society. Justice must be delivered, but only as per procedure.
2066	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NSA must probe this issue like bardhwan blast and deport all Bangladeshis.
2067	2015-03-08 00:00:00	even if he was a rapist he should have not been killed without trial. i pray to God that all those who are supporting the killing of a person unknown whether he did it or not just because he was a muslim and labelling him a Bangladeshi although they have been hearing that one of his brother sacrificed his life in kargil and other two brothers are still in indian army and his late father was in indian airforce and his mother still gets the pension..i pray all these hate mongers face similar situation in life or their own male members of their family ifaces mob justice for a crime they never committed
2068	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The overall law and order situation across the nation except a few states is ALARMING! The Centre, it seems, has failed to rein in the trouble makers!  It is indulged in publicity in the name of "development" and pay scant attention to burning problems.
2069	2015-03-08 00:00:00	this shows that everyone is loosing faith in working procedure of our judicial.....(slow &amp; injustice)
2070	2015-03-08 00:00:00	We have a system which requires that guilty should be convicted even though there may be several flaws in it. So long as we are not abandoning it, we have to follow it for the simple reason of orderliness. Nobody supports a criminal who raped. But the law of the land does not award death sentence for rape. So don't you think it is unlawful to have killed him? I remember that the current government did not accept the proposal of Maneka Ji on punishment to rapists.
2071	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There are many Nirbhya-man as well. There are many Indian sons in jail because of false rape case filed by India daughters. Indian son also need help and protection from legal terrorism on man.  We want Indian women to denounce these criminal women who files false rape/498a/dv cases on men and come forward to support Indian victim-sons.
2072	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is no disease so destructive as lust.
2073	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is totally frame and he was killed becouse he is muslim. If not then why serving bryani to thise rapist who interview ? Come on muslims have to accept that being minority is crime of century . STILL JAI HIND
2074	2015-03-08 00:00:00	All this is because our court and judgement system takes very long time to give judgement;so people are losing patience;but lynching is not justified.
2075	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Build multiple direct connections to assam!
2076	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Another documentary will come out in the world &amp;then regretting. those who broke the law, shall be punished in accordance with law.
2077	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is clear that the man is a victim of false allegation of rape. The video footage shown by News Agency of Assam ,indicates that she got entered to a hotel room with him and went out from there in a cool manner. There may be some consensual relationship between them. Moreover medical examination by doctor denies any rape or torture. He was a permanent resident of Karimgang district of Assam. Father of him served in Indian Air Force and MES. One  brother of him is presently serving Indian Army and another  brother also served in Indian Army and died on duty earlier. So framing one man as Bangladeshi viewing religion is highly condemnable. It is seen that Nagas are doing atrocity and terrorising Non Nagas who go to Nagaland for business purpose. So this may be planned task to terrorise  and flash out Non-nagas having business establishment there. From the past history, of Assam it was seen that the Ahom kings of Assam sent soldiers/army  to Nagaland several times only because , the Nagas were doing unlawful ctivities and torturing and killing innocent people. According to status ,published in local daily of Assam, in pat 10 years 185 innocent people of Assam have been killed by the unlawful Nagas. They are torching many border assamese border villages and occupying the villages by flashing out assamese local people. They are taking money/haptah from small tea garden owners, businessmen . Some Nagas will rent a vehicle to Nagaland from Assam, and in the middle of journey they take away the vehicle by killing the assamese driver. So it is evident that there is prevailing an acute lawlessness there. This type of heinous crime by Nagas to Assamese people is not acceptable and we request Central Govt and Assam state Govt to take strong measures, investigate the case by CBI ,  fetch out the culprits and book them  under law.
2078	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The police and judiciary have lost their credibility that is these things are happening.
2079	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Law should not have been taken into hands by people. If he was pronounced guilty then if this event would have happened, I would not feel that bad but this is like punishing someone without a trial... I am not sympathising with rapist, and feel they should be castraded and jailed for life or hung but only post trial...
2080	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The CM knew everything ! Can the elected politician say he didn't knew anything happening among his very people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nonsense ! Arrest him first and everything will be out !!!!
2081	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why this rapist that too a bangladsei is given so much coverage
2082	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ALL RAPIST IS HINDUS.
2083	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Last i heard he was an INDIAN and secondly he was just an accused so please correct ur facts before spreading such fuds
2084	2015-03-08 00:00:00	While this is happening, i bet BBC is busy preparing on another documentary seeking justice for the rape accused
2085	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It appears to me that the article supports rape. For it is completely in favor of the accused. Even the govt is supporting for they cut electricity and other facilities (as I read in other articles). Very sad. Rape Jihad supported by Politics!! God save our country
2086	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The article supports Judicial process b'coz it is the essence of democracy. I u have a problem with our democratic process u r free to leave this country..:)
2087	2015-03-09 00:00:00	So if some thing is going wrong and justice is taking too long time, shortcuts are enforced by some people for justice and people support that, then the supporting people should leave that country and that system should not be corrected. Is it what you are telling?
2088	2015-03-08 00:00:00	We got to stop this vigilante justice mentality. This is well ... very third world mentality. Anyone who beat this person up should be booked for murder.
2089	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Keep all bangladeahis along with their local supporter out of India.
2090	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No matter whether the guy was framed or not but this is a general failure of the administration and judiciary.
2091	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What happened to the rape victim?
2092	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Samir ( India )    The last comment was from me.
2093	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NOW IT SHOULD BE SEEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO LADY WHO FRAMED FALSE CHARGES AGAINST THIS PERSON THIS HAS BECOME DAILY AFFAIRS FOR THE FEMALES NOW MEDIA IS JUST FACING ITS OWN FACE BY NOT HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT IT WAS FALSE CHARGES
2094	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Well it is not yet proved if the girl was raped or not yet since police    arrested him the mob pulled him out from high security jail &amp; lynched him what's security personnel &amp; police were doing or is it that he was not a Naga that's why he was lynched Dismiss Nagaland Govt. immediately
2095	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why women organization is not coming forward to look into this rape case?? WhY/  Ban women organization, it is a terrorist organization who creates legal terrorism on man.  The man (Nirbhya-Khan) is now bead, he wasn't rapist. Feminist paid Medias are not reporting the truth as truth that he was a victim of false rape allegation. Mob killed the man because he was a Bengali-muslim and married a naga women. Naga people did not like it. Now his naga-sister-in-law filed a false rape case on him because rape case is more stronger than 498a. The dead body sent to mother and father but his naga-wife sitting at Naga did not accept her husband's dead body. Feminist media is hiding all these truth information. He was not a rapist. He is a victim of a false rape accusation. It can happen to you as well anytime the what will you do? You don't have to rape anyone. India is not safe for man because of these legal terrorist on men.
2096	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hindus are a junglee race...
2097	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The concerned parties are Muslim and Christian. Hindus would have accepted the marriage eventually.
2098	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The guy was innocent until proved guilty. Hindus has a habitvof murdering Muslims. So stop this he drserve it thing you saffronites.
2099	2015-03-08 00:00:00	shut up or next will be your turn.
2100	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The man accused is not a Bengali emigrant. He and his family is just a Bengali Muslim residing in Assam. His father has served Indian Air Force. His 3 brothers joined Indian Army. One brother gave his life in the kargil war. Two are still serving the nation. As for the matter of rape accusation is considered, people did not kill the person because he was accused of rape but because he was thought to be Bangladeshi immigrant, as the girl booked case against two people. The other being a Naga is not touched. Moreover the accused was booked on the basis of a cctv, where he was shown entering the hotel with the girl with her consent. The other side of the story is that the girl used to charge for sex and when not paid the right amount booked the case. But whatever might be the issue, what Nagaland government did is shameful. They could have surely stopped that. A mob of 10k doesn't come without making any noise.
2101	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dont portray rapist as victim. Such incident will only deter people from making sexual advance on women.
2102	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Read other news media.  The medical reports hadn't confirmed rape, a claim repeated by the Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi to TV reporters. Home ministry sources said the woman who had leveled the rape charges knew Khan well. "The girl and her associates had demanded Rs 2 lakh from him," Khan's younger brother Suberuddin said. The police said they were yet to receive medical reports.
2103	2015-03-08 00:00:00	kip it up...i like da way naga people punished khan...
2104	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He deserved what he got
2105	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Girish is your sister at home?
2106	2015-03-08 00:00:00	oh Bagladeshis again.
2107	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It appears to be Modi Magic, hehehehe LOL.
2108	2015-03-08 00:00:00	out  dated penal codes are  failed  in  India-- peoples are  believing  religious punishment  laws--  Naga-s  done  Islamic  law  against   that   Muslim  rapist  in my  view  it  is right,  if a Hindu--  he  will  go  trishool  or  Christan--  he  will  go  cross--no  need  of  any  judgement  from  sarkar  after 100  years
2109	2015-03-08 00:00:00	im an hindu,  guys pls dont bring religion here.   more over naga land people has done good thing I congratulate them heartly.   this must be a lesson for all the rapists.   this news must make public.  a small tendency to commit this kind of crimes must be punished severely.
2110	2015-03-08 00:00:00	India journalists /media are Anti-India. Soon they will face the same fate...............stone media people to death.............India problem is resolved...............
2111	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You speak like a Talibani or Arabic barbarian where stoning by death is common. A day will come when you will take India to stone age by trying to imitate the radical Muslims..
2112	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its for the media we are getting reports like this.
2113	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Wherever there is social chaos , social divisions , or unrest muslims are the reason  Protests in Nagaland as illegal bangla muslim raped s naga girl Protests in Assam by the strong muslim community because he was a muslim ---never mind  being a rapist .
2114	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He wasn't rapist. Media is not reporting that he was a victim of false rape allegation.
2115	2015-03-08 00:00:00	he is a suspect. not a rapist. you people must know the basic difference between suspect and criminal. indian take movies with rape criminals ( Nirbaya ) and they kill the rape suspect.
2116	2015-03-08 00:00:00	1) Wake up call for our judiciary, police and administration to render quick justice. Public believes "Law will take its course" BUT ONLY AFTER DECADES and result in a penury of justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. So, in context of the pitiable state of justice, anarchy is natural and people WILL start taking law into their own hands.  2) The entire protest going on against the lynching, especially in Assam, is, by and for the fact this guy was Muslim. Muslims around the world ensure that their kind cannot be touched.  3) In almost all cases of rape by Muslims, including that of the Japanese tourist in Bihar, they claim that the victim is lying and framing. So, nothing new.
2117	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So at least once the Shariah has been applied to deliver justice! Why no one is talking about the Girl?
2118	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yeh bangladeshi hein bhagao inko
2119	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Govt was never serious on this issue! This could happen to anywhere in India.
2120	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what a solidarity .... protest for a killer ... wao !! is it because he is a muslim. it is an open secret that most of the assamies muslims are illegal bangaladeshi immigrant.
2121	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Protesting now so that these guys can get free hands in raping non-Muslim women
2122	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nagas wants separation from Indian brutal occupation.
2123	2015-03-08 00:00:00	if its  true that he is not a rapist after medical examination of girl then this is wrong.
2124	2015-03-08 00:00:00	People can't take law into their hand...The culprits should be punished severely....
2125	2015-03-08 00:00:00	MILLIONS  OF  INNOCENTS  ARE  LANGUISHING  IN  INDIAN  PRISONS  BUT  DO  NOT  HAVE  THE  RESOURCES  TO  FIGHT  THEIR  CASES .
2126	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Totally unfortunate and these inhuman Nagaland mobs must be encountered shoot at sight. Once you do this no other gangsters will dare kill people and taking the law into their hands. A innocent man has been killed just because of blackmail by a lady.
2127	2015-03-08 00:00:00	One more Mu$l!m dead is no news..this is like one more male goat sacrificed on Eid... I mean mu$l!m dying in india is so insignificant that no body cares..!!!
2128	2015-03-08 00:00:00	good news btw ....
2129	2015-03-08 00:00:00	WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her poor ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished ans much yearned dream Yet you made sure she never bagged even that humble dream! Going to a movie with a kith when the night was still tender Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so good and tender Her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat Instead of bedecking her bridal chamber with blooms most fragrant and bright, sod! And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry loud and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-smeared parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream, sod! Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that agony-torn mummy Will scorch the earth? And you never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so sub-human to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains embedded in the intellect; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Heven is only a place on earth; you know not? Why you didn't  really know that even I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not Mind! But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you hear it or take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Unscrupulous hypocrite and stealer of all human happiness, was it too much to ask for?
2130	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A REQUIEM FOR NIRBHAYA "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!

2134	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Nagaland's racist government can say any thing for justifying lynching, those racists were also calling this guy illegal, those racists arrested this guy without even proper investigation first.  girls is scamster, she wanted 200000 Rs from accused but he didn't give that so she filed a rape report.
2135	2015-03-08 00:00:00	assam CM is a cow of bangladesh. he has brought muslims from bangaldesh to create vote bank. no good CM here. waiting for elections 2016. or i'll have to be the CM of assam.
2136	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Its you Aryans who came from Europe and those Nagas who came from China, Muslim in state have been living for thousands of years.
2137	2015-03-09 00:00:00	A six-year-old girl was allegedly sexually attacked by Kaushal Chauhan who inserted an iron rod into her private parts What about this rapist from Gujrat?  No strict action will be taken because of Hindu vote?
2138	2015-03-09 00:00:00	he will be hanged till death. or public should get the accused out of jail and beat him up. keeping a rapist alive for longer duration in jail creates another rapists. labours should be educated not to rape any girl. There are emotional need a women will have. things they don't want to do will be attempt to rape. let public do the justice. this is so different from any other crimes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;coming to muslims in india. the rate at which they are increasing is a threat to india. common their ideologies are way old up and they   will say one thing in morning and do the opposite in evening. India is a secular country, that's true. but muslims are misleading, its fact. it is better when they are separated from india. for example what is happening in jammu and kashmir. the head of india is gone. mufti is the leader. definitely getting kashmir back is like a dream come true.&lt;br/&gt;what is happening in assam and the sisterly states. many of the districts like dhubri, cachar, goalpara are completely occupied by muslims. after 10 years what do you expect? north east will have majority of muslims then.
2139	2015-03-10 00:00:00	People like you need to be killed on sight, because you people cause communal violence and mass rapes.
2140	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sorry to say this, but there's been a concerted effort, especially from the speakers of a particular language, in the press and on social media, to whip up a conspiracy theory. Can a person be sent to judicial custody without any prima facie evidence? If the accused was "framed" at all, why wasn't there a single protest from the accused or his family or his sympathizers from the day of the arrest till he was lynched? Why are we seeing so much sympathy for a rape accused and suspicion of a rape victim? Because the accused belonged to a certain religion or spoke certain language?
2141	2015-03-10 00:00:00	"Naga women do NOT need to be raped, they are waiting opportunity to open always specially to non-naga guys to explore different tastes, that's happening wherever naga women go - Delhi, Mumbai etc. A 15 years old gal roam with con*d*m. Dimapur is full of naga women pros*tit*tions n sometimes entire family involved in this business. In a family men join NSCN naga terrorists n women join prost*tu*tion. Whatever happened is Naga tribal groupism n racism without seeing justice" -A comment read
2142	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I agree with your comment. and yes medical report also clam that girl was raped. sorry by mistake i hit the disagree button.
2143	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Yes a person can be sent to prison even though prima facie evidence is contrary , just a statement from a woman is enough. There are thousands of men in prison with just a report made by the woman even after 2 yrs. The law is undoubtedly favouring the females
2144	2015-03-10 00:00:00	These female Nazis take revenge from men if men don't give them money.
2145	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Now the sympathy goes to the rape accused because  He is killed and his crime is not proved
2146	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No one is showing any sympathy what so ever for the accused however, death from stone pelting might be a fashion in Arab world but we cannot let it happen in our country. Taking revenge of an inhumane act by another inhumane act is the "eye for an eye" theory that is not acceptable in modern world. I am all for justice to the victim but a raging crowd does not differentiate between a culprit and innocent.
2147	2015-03-08 00:00:00	don't bring language or religion into this. Naga people always want a separate country for them. They can't even live peacefully with their neighboring state Assam. So many news recently came that Naga people attacked people of Assam in bordering area. Also Naga police helped to occupy land from Assam to Naga people.
2148	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Nagas are illegal immigrants from China, they should be kicked out from country.
2149	2015-03-09 00:00:00	A six-year-old girl was allegedly sexually attacked by Kaushal Chauhan who inserted an iron rod into her private parts What about this rapist from Gujrat? No strict action will be taken because culprit belongs to certain religion?  :)
2150	2015-03-08 00:00:00	First Report Say No Rape......... Then Second Report Come......... It's Rape................. Now Who R Really Fools And Haters............ We Know That...... :)
2151	2015-03-08 00:00:00	there is no first report, it was just a rumor started by the rapist brother
2152	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Great , Now we should wait for third report................hahaha
2153	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Lynching can't be accepted in any manner and we know about first medical report this is second medical report and we should also wait for third funny medical report.
2154	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So now are we suppose to give reservations to some particular caste in rape also.... okay general caste rape sentence of 7 years... minority caste..... 3.5 years....  I hate when people create cast ism in such crime as rape.... that too some female...  daisy your name is good but you are rightly sorry and you should be for your comment.
2155	2015-03-09 00:00:00	A six-year-old girl was allegedly sexually attacked by Kaushal Chauhan who inserted an iron rod into her private parts What about this rapist from Gujrat? No strict action will be taken because culprit belongs to particular community?
2156	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Cause u dont know what happens to all outsiders in North East. You got to live there to experience. Even peaceful protests are silenced by guns (and they blame the underground --easy way out). Any outsider, has no say in any of the hill states where the locals treat them with barbarism. The local media is too timid and the mainstream media never covers these stuff for lack of TRP. The people who are shouting "justice served" cause the accused was a Muslim.......just fyi that the locals treat the Hindus also in the same barbaric way.
2157	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Another one ranting away. Aren't you going to defame the women from those areas? Your kind usually does, be it to subdue the other person or make yourself feel good!
2158	2015-03-09 00:00:00	One of those who rants and the complaint-box types. Aren't you going to defame the women of the NE region? I heard your kind usualu uses it as a method to kind of subdue someone from the region you are arguing with or to feel good about it!
2159	2015-03-08 00:00:00	IF RAPE IS TRUE THEN NAGA PEOPLE HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING TO THIS ILLEGAL BHANGLADESHI . KUDOS TO THE PEOPLE OF NAGALAND . PROTECT YOUR LAND FROM THESE ILLEGAL BHANGLADESHIS
2160	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Its Nagas who are illegals from China, Muslims should protect their land from these illegals from China.
2161	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If the woman was raped then why care for the killing of the culprit, if he is really the culprit?
2162	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Nothing has been proven yet.
2163	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Now all Bangali Speaking Assamese muslims will say that rape was not done by that " Shariff" man, DNA tests, bone marrow tests and plasma tests etc. will be demanded, suffers will be the  Real Assamese and Nagas
2164	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I had been in Dimapur, I felt that Nagas had strong community feelings. The government administration is a joke here. People do as they like. The local mafia rule the government. I was surprised to see non naga shops close as early as 6pm while the nagas have their shop open till 11pm. Too bad they get all the extra benefits of the Indian tax subsidy but would not allow anybody to work or survive here.
2165	2015-03-08 00:00:00	so what do you expect the govt of india to do.....??? Were nagas part of indian union ??? or were nagas indians in the first place??  What is preventing the govt of india to take action against the terror outfits like NSCN which are running a parallel mafia style country in nagaland??? Why is there absolute silence and how do you think govt resolve this issue???

Fine-grained phase shifting allows all DCM output clocks to be phase-shifted with respect to CLKIN while maintaining the relationship between the coarse phase outputs. With fixed mode, a fixed fraction of phase shift can be defined during configuration and in multiples of the clock period divided by 256. Using the variable-positive and variable-center modes the phase can be dynamically and repetitively moved forward and backwards by 1/256 of the clock period.

2175	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Clock Deskew Operation The deskew feature utilizes the DLL circuit in the DCM. In its simplest form, the DLL consists of a single variable delay line (containing individual small delay elements or buffers) and control logic. The incoming clock drives the delay line. The output of every delay element represents a version of the incoming clock (CLKIN) delayed at a different point. The clock distribution network routes the clock to all internal registers and to the clock feedback CLKFB pin.

Its the bars and restaurants that are open till wee hours. The bars are usually owned by local men/women as they would have to keep dealing with the local militant outfits there who keeps coming in for alcohol tax and this and that. That is the only case. Please dont b**ls**t bruh.

Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey We know nothing of even today Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Jyothi and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!

After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her poor ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished ans much yearned dream Yet you made sure she never bagged even that humble dream! Going to a movie with a kith when the night was still tender Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so good and tender Her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat Instead of bedecking her bridal chamber with blooms most fragrant and bright, sod! And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry loud and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-smeared parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream, sod! Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that agony-torn mummy Will scorch the earth? And you never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so sub-human to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains embedded in the intellect; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Heven is only a place on earth; you know not? Why you didn't  really know that even I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not Mind! But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you hear it or take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Unscrupulous hypocrite and stealer of all human happiness, was it too much to ask for?

2224	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Did u see the interview of the rape victim? Do not get influenced by Indian paid media who will defend a Muslim terrorist &amp; rapist. Also  Above all, I cant trust Muzzies.... they can do anything possible... look at the data of criminals in India by religion, Muzzies top on it...
2225	2015-03-08 00:00:00	They did the right the thing by punishing the man. At least some people would think before committing rape
2226	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Seems like you did not study the report properly.The man was not the rapist,in fact he was a "Grahak".And definitely who ever commits rape must be put to death.But this man was not a rapist.
2227	2015-03-08 00:00:00	aakhir toh musalmaan hi nikla na woh. bohat kharap soch hain musalmano ki toh.
2228	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Did u see the interview of the rape victim? Do not get influenced by Indian paid media who will defend a Muslim terrorist &amp; rapist.
2229	2015-03-08 00:00:00	it seems that you does not believe in indian judiciary system.
2230	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I also agree with you
2231	2015-03-08 00:00:00	At time justice by society is better than Judiciary.... only the rape victim knows the pain. Why not these Muslims fight for rape victim and women rights?
2232	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims say rapist must be hanged.Unlike your chaddis
2233	2015-03-08 00:00:00	if he was rapist , he should be hanged, but when court has not decided and medical resport deny it, and second thing why all rapsit of communal riots of gujrat and meerut are not hanged till now, muslim do not support rapist , islam give severe punishmnent to rapist, hang him in a weak, but we oppose discrimination of rapist on basis of religion,
2234	2015-03-08 00:00:00	are u sure? read your books properly....
2235	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Totally unfortunate and these inhuman Nagaland mobs must be encountered shoot at sight. Once you do this no other gangsters will dare kill people and taking the law into their hands. A innocent man has been killed just because of blackmail by a lady.
2236	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The alleged rape victim was sister in law of the accused and was alleged to have been blackmailing the accused. Please keep on following the news . Already the Nagaland CM is on backfoot as the medical examination has not established rape.
2237	2015-03-08 00:00:00	are u a witness of rape how r u so confident
2238	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What a fool you are? Do you need to witness to identify the criminal? What kind of mentality is that? The victim was not blind and she had been raped continuously for two days.  Is that not enough to identify that criminal? You should read the article once again to understand it clearly. Do not ever ask such questions any one again. Probably you might have done the same thing in the past and flew KSA.  isn't it?
2239	2015-03-08 00:00:00	continuously for two days ? u should be in court sir and if u want to know about me if any one inc u looks twice at any women of any cast any color any background in front of me next thing they will be doing is asking the best doctor to repair a broken jaw
2240	2015-03-10 00:00:00	You should be having some commonsense to think and comment properly. It was in the news that the guy took the girl on 23rd Feb and he raped her continuously on 23rd and 24th in different places. What do mean by I should be in the court? I am telling a false story? or fabricating? It seems you are mad and that is the reason you are claiming that you are so valiant. Probably you are talking from a mental hospital! Probably you may have to find a doctor for broken jaw if you talk the same in front of someone else.
2241	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Are u confident that he was rapist, how can a man rape a girl twice and thrice, and she did not lodged complain first time. P
2242	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Let that happen to your wife or sister than you yourself will update us.
2243	2015-03-08 00:00:00	People like you, the reply will come from the people of Nagaland and you will find it difficult to answer. Shameless fellow. Whom you are  trying to fool?   Idiot, is that girl blind to identify the rapist.? You fool read the article once again to understand the incident clearly.
2244	2015-03-08 00:00:00	a mob of 1000 people will not have the intensity that they had... if they werent confident and sure of the criminal's activity.
2245	2015-03-08 00:00:00	these r the ones who want to break the country if attacking rapist why burnt shops if they did the right thing why afraid of going to assam
2246	2015-03-10 00:00:00	"The man, identified as 35-year-old Syed Farid Khan, was in custody after being arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a girl who was his neighbour multiple times between 23 and 24 February. According to one report, Khan dealt in second hand vehicles and had called the girl over for a meal but then raped her after she was intoxicated. He then reportedly took her to a hotel where she was sexually assaulted again. Representational image. ReutersRepresentational image. Reuters After the girl filed a complaint with the police on 24 February, Khan was arrested on the same day". Is this report not enough for you to believe that he is a rapist? Or what you intended to? Have you been with him to ensure that he is innocent? This kind of mentality is very bad for any society. So you simply out to support the rapists across the country. Because some are enjoying their life with free food accommodation in Jail and having enough security. Later became celebrity as BBC come and picturise them to make heroes.  That is what you are looking for?.  We should pull out every rapist and give the same treatment. Then only they will learn to stay away from doing rape.
2247	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I tend to agree with you, I wish people never spare child rapist, no trial, no bail, just public lynching.
2248	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No rapist should be spared, however one cannot be punished on the basis of merry suspicion.
2249	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Guptaji,  Weak criminal minds were there in the medieval period as well as today and will remain eternally.  Most worrying part is society becoming insensitive. Looking at the crowd cheering  lynching a mob looks primitive. It will not be long before they do this to an innocent person, simply because they are deriving pleasure out of it.  Such acts have never prevented any crimes. Proper enforcement of law and order is the ONLY option. Even cops should not have powers to thrash someone. I know you may say our judiciary is impotent, so lets address that issue instead of opting for anarchy.
2250	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Being primitive is lot better than having rotten and corrupt judiciary
2251	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Country isn't ruled by a monarch or a dictator. We the people have made this rotten and corrupt Judiciary. We create judiciary to evolve from primitive practices. Your suggestion leads to reverse evolution.
2252	2015-03-08 00:00:00	When your family meneber is raped( may god not happen) you preach your 20 paisa philosophy to us
2253	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If my family member is raped, I would be possessed by rage. I may want to kill the rapist, may want to burn the whole society down. But the Society should do the thinking on my behalf, help me and my family overcome the trauma and prevent me from getting engulfed by hate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look at the video and tell me how many have any sympathy for the victim? Look at some of the smiling faces, they are excited about the opportunity they have got to unleash their animal instincts. That is bothering. If we sympathize with such primal instincts, we should remember Rape itself is such an instinct. Natural law on god's earth is "Survival of the fittest". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has that man really raped the victim, I don't know. If indeed, then he should be punished and the victim should be comforted, supported and compensated by the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All those who think this punishment will send a message to rapists have to think messages are intercepted by thinkers who thoughtfully commit a crime. Crimes committed instinctively lack consequential reasoning. May be it will deter some but will victimize far more innocents.
2254	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I fully agree with you.  Is it fair to kill a person when he is facing inquiry in a police station and police stand as on lookers?  The people taking taking law in tho their hand will behave like terrorists in Iraq and Syria sooner or later.
2255	2015-03-08 00:00:00	i kind of agree with you. but the length of trial even in ghastly crime cases is so long that the general people cant stand the test of that time.
2256	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Length of trials is equivalent to what can be called as "experiencing hell" and that is exactly why we need to address that issue. If lynch mobs can address that issue, I am up for it.
2257	2015-03-08 00:00:00	the legal system of the country have got to speed up. simple. otherwise these kind of incidents will recur...and in gretaer frequency!
2258	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yes it will be if people like you who think like europeans and live in india is confused. even today small girl was killed. the rapist put 4 foot rod inside 6 years old girl. what u want? democracy......
2259	2015-03-08 00:00:00	"yes it will be... live in India is confused". What?? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am deeply pained by the news of a 6 year old been brutalized. Do I want democracy? I want society to become sensitive and less violent. Type of government is a different topic altogether. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The animal that committed such a crime should be quarantined/executed by appropriate authority without civilians losing their civility.
2260	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Review the footage and arrest all the guilty.
2261	2015-03-08 00:00:00	guilty is killed.........
2262	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Brother, i he was indeed raped someone he must have been prosecuted and even dealth sentance can be awarded. But this happend bcause the accused was muslim. Accusation doesn't means he was involved in rape unless proved. Just imagine if you were falsely accused and lynched by mob becase of you are from another community.
2263	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NRC has been made to remove all the muslims from north east and india dude. your suggestion holds good but we want india to be free from muslims. our ideologies doesn't match right ? hey you know that. its very true. so many years if a problem persists its time to sort out.
2264	2015-03-08 00:00:00	India is not your daddy's property that you think Muslims will just roll over. Why don't you ask your mai baap RSS to do something as instead of fulfilling your dream of Muslim free India, they are letting Muslims free in Kashmir, from jails! aakhir tumharey baap Modi ko kya mirgi aa gayi?
2265	2015-03-08 00:00:00	tere bhai ke liye coffin tayaar rakh. jinda hi gaar denge tujhe bhi. chalo india ka zameen mein paida hua musalmaan india mein hi mar gaya.
2266	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I agree with your point. But please do not play the community card, that will reduce the respect to your community and your words. Please take it as a suggestion, if you care.
2267	2015-03-08 00:00:00	community angle is wide and clear shops were attacked on the way
2268	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You are already playing the religious card. Let see what the courts decide on that matter. If he was wrongly framed it must be strongly condemned and action taken against police and the lynchers. Otherwise people like you who have already started playing the dirty religion card should be punished.
2269	2015-03-08 00:00:00	and if he is rapist......you will take equal share of his crime.......omen
2270	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Precisely Yes.  What right people has to go to a Jail,drag out a accused and kill him brutally merely because he is a accused.  This will soon lead to anarchy in our country.
2271	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Your border is protected by Nepalese and Gorkhas.... Your sister and daughter are dancing and producing for muslims.....you are like chakka siting in your home passing your time in net ...... anarchy sound so soft. Nagas are great they killed who raped their daughter and sister.....    what about you??????
2272	2015-03-08 00:00:00	keep crying in the name of religion now
2273	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So where is the proof that he was accused just because he is muslim?
2274	2015-03-08 00:00:00	rightly said. Taking law into own hands is the ideal recipe for bigger trouble in the future. The incident is most unfortunate and reflects people's loss of faith in the judiciary and laxity on part of the jail authorities.
2275	2015-03-08 00:00:00	no body cares whether he is muslim...only you...  , and you are supporting a rapist.....people like you are more dangerous than rapist..... hope you have daughter and sister too.... will you spare a rapist if he is a muslim??????
2276	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why Muslim need to do rapes instead of having four wives at home. Why Buddhists/Sikhs/Jains/Jews do not do such debasing acts? Why only Muslims?
2277	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why everyone is targeting only particular community ? not only in India but all over world? did someone try to introspect  ?
2278	2015-03-08 00:00:00	its time the so called Muslims should think seriously about it
2279	2015-03-08 00:00:00	because the community is doing more atrocities around the world in the name of religion.
2280	2015-03-08 00:00:00	dont bring religious card here,people from nagaland are known to harass outsiders irrespective of their religion.
2281	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims want secularism in India and elsewhere where they are minority. Can you request your Saudi masters to implement the same? in nations having muslim majority? In Saudi the rape victim gets 200 lashes!
2282	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rape in Islam is beheading or stoning till death, it is a serious crime. Punishment is not to the accused, punishment must be to the criminal after crime to be proved. In Saudia punishment will be awarded after so many trials to accused and they confirmed the crime prior to punishment. Nagalnd people are racial, He was running a good business and Bengali. He was killed not for his religion but for out side race
2283	2015-03-08 00:00:00	you are indian or saudi? you are confused?
2284	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Just couple of days ago there was a news that in S Arabia a gang rape victim has been ordered 200 lashes and custodial sentence. Saudi are so horrible that they punish the victim. Why because that draconian law called sharia want 4 male witness for a rape victim. As if the rapists themselves will say that yes we raped the hapless girl. Islam has the worst law. Don't bring Islamic law in a civil debate.
2285	2015-03-08 00:00:00	YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG CALLING "YOUR SAUDI MASTERS" THIS ITSELF SHOWS YOUR CULT. SAUDIS ARE NOT DEALING WITH AFFAIRS OF MUSLIMS IN INDIA, AND ALSO YOU HAVE POOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SAUDI, 200 LASHES ARE FOR ADULTERY, RAPE HAS CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
2286	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Capital punishment means nothing when in the stupid sharia law you need 4 male witness to prove rape. Otherwise the rape victim herself gets punished!!! Couple of days ago there was a news that in S Arabia a gang rape victim has been ordered 200 lashes and custodial sentence! That's Islamic law for you, pretty idiotic.
2287	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sharia law can be debated on another platform not on this issue, Since Ignorant here can only vomit rant. You will find no corner if that is to be debated. By the way how many witnesses do a "Democratic" Judicial system needs to hand down the judgement on rape if it is not to consider the Medical and DNA examinations ? the answer will end it all.
2288	2015-03-08 00:00:00	indian muslims have no business in saudi nor are saudis masters of any indian. India is a sovereign country. In this case the man was lynched because he was just an ACCUSED
2289	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Medical examination of the girl, who alleged rape, indicated that there had been no sexual assault.................... What U Peoples Think We Don't Care............ U Peoples Killed That man On The Basis Of Religion....... Now Just Wait For Revenge.
2290	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what else you pigs can think.
2291	2015-03-08 00:00:00	babaji ka thullu. 15 min police bandh ho gayi toh sare hindustan mein sirf hindu reh jayenge. tu allah ke paas pahuch jayega. tera allah tera insaaf karega. samjhe beta. aab jaldi se rawalpindi chala jao aur kabhi india wapis na aana.
2292	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Toh Pahonche De..... Paglo..... Teri G Mai Dum Hai Toh................... Humlog Toh Keh Ke Lenge...... 20 25 Saal Baad Toh Hamri Hi Rule Ana Hai Phir Se :)
2293	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Don't talk of revenge. No one scared of you. The whole world is against you. And you people don't have the brains to win in the 21st century. Your defeat and extinction as a belief system is coming.
2294	2015-03-08 00:00:00	BiTc@ we are half of world.
2295	2015-03-08 00:00:00	is this the way justice is to be discharged?
2296	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Gupta...Nagaland Doctor's have confirmed that it was not a "RAPE"..just based on suspicious he has been lynched..put your own brother in place of him &amp; think deep...you'll come to know about your words...brush up your mind, And even he committed rape he must needed a trail. And for extremely  heinous crime that kind of punishment is not available in democracy country like INDIA..If you considered that was good..then according to you what punishment would you grant for the accused of NIRBHAYA rape case? think again bro...and "change your thinking, India will change"
2297	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Police did not arrest the criminal women who files false rape allegation on the man.  The woman is the rapist, she should be arrested.
2298	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Courts should punish only the culprits.  Here in this, a accused who could have been a innocent was killed brutally.  Will this stop at this level.  The hatred will spread and people start attacking each other.  Nobody as you claim will think when they rape a innocent women.  These should be left to courts to decide.
2299	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The guy may or may not be innocent. The courts had not given the verdict. Just because the public did what they did does not make him innocent no more than his arrest makes him a criminal.
2300	2015-03-08 00:00:00	are you mentally sick? What if it was consensual sex and the girl framed him for money? These Nagas are one of the most violent lawless people. They wanted separate country. It took lot of efforts to tame them.
2301	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Disagree with the last part of the comment.
2302	2015-03-08 00:00:00	listen to her interview on ndtv she is sitting a car with two men one goes to brings drinks she waits one walks out other rape why she went is not clear moreover she walked into hotel for this crime to be commited
2303	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You mean to say allegations are good enough to kill people?There is a rape accused in Modi government so you mean to say he should also be lynched? By the way there are two versions of the event . Please read the news paper reports. I am reproducing the excerpt of Indian Express report - "Syed Sharif Khan, the small-time used-car dealer who was lynched by a mob that barged into the Dimapur Central Jail here on Thursday afternoon, after he was accused of raping a tribal college girl, came from a family of Armymen. One of his brothers, the family said, had died serving. “We are not Bangladeshi infiltrators. We come from a family of patriots,” Sharif’s brother Syed Suberuddin Khan told The Sunday Express. He took Sharif’s body home, to Bosla village in Karimganj in south Assam, on Saturday, on a helicopter arranged by the Assam government. RELATED Eighteen Arrested For Dimapur Lynching Incident Hundreds Of Girls In School, College Uniforms Led Lynch Mob, Says Dimapur SP Lynching Of Rape Accused: 3 Suspended, Judicial Probe Ordered Soon after the lynching, some groups had called Sharif an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant, while state DGP LL Doungel had said he was suspected to be so. Suberuddin said Sharif was one of seven brothers and two sisters. “Our eldest brother who was in the Army died while in service, while two brothers, Syed Jamal Khan and Syed Kamal Khan, are with the Assam Regiment.” Their father Syed Hussain Khan served and retired from Military Engineering Service (MES). The alleged rape victim was sister in law of the accused and was alleged to have been blackmailing the accused. Please keep on following the news . Already the Nagaland CM is on backfoot as the medical examination has not established rape.
2304	2015-03-08 00:00:00	sure , if he was rapist then i expect same treatment for all rapist of gujrat and meerut riot case, would police hand over all rapist to muslim mob? if he was not rapist then all naga mob should be hanged like terrorist afzal guru and kassab, and strict action should be taken for all police force who handed him to the mob
2305	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mob killed the man because he was a Bengali and married a naga women.  Gana people did not like it.  Now his sister-in-law filed a false rape case on him because rape case is more stronger than 498a.  The dead body sent to mother and father but the his naga-wife sitting in naga did not accept his husband's dead body.  Feminist media is hiding all these information.  He was not a rapist.  He is a victim of a false rape accusation.  It can happen to you as well anytime the what will you do?  You don't have to rape anyone.  India is not safe for man because of these legal terrorist on men.
2306	2015-03-08 00:00:00	U cannot disobey the law and get away with it. Tomorrow, dozens of such incidents could happen and it could result in a total breakdown of the law &amp; order machinery. Don't be sentimental and think logically
2307	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SHlTHole India will remain the same dark dysfunctional mess forever!  India is the Rape capital of the world.  There are thousands of the rapes being committed everyday in this hell-hole but the saffron primitives do not break in to the jails everyday to kill the alleged rapists.  But here the alleged is a Muslim by name and the saffron primitives did what they are always good at, they staged yet another drama to kill yet another Indian who is a Muslim by name....
2308	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So if you are in another community dominated area and get accussed, do you think your lynching based on accusation would be justified? By other I mean linguistic, casteist, ethnic or religious..Good luck.
2309	2015-03-08 00:00:00	20 agree to u and only 9 disagree shows pathetic state of mind of Indian people who have completely lost the faith in judiciary
2310	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is 1 thing common between majority of those who 'agree' and 'disagree'. That is they are scared to come out of their biases. Many of those who disagree are Muslims who think they have been victimized in this case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are likely to support a Hindu rapist being lynched to death for committing such a crime in Muslim majority area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off-course not all, some are genuinely concerned of society getting violent.
2311	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Though I agree with your sentiments, I do not agree with the execution, simply because he was an accused and not a criminal. Chances are that the police may have caught the wrong guy too. However its time that the government makes sure that modern technology like DNA and all are used to confirm the crimes like rape at the earliest (within few weeks) and the rapist are hanged within a year of committing the crime. This will also stop stupid people like BBC to make documentaries out of suc incidents.
2312	2015-03-08 00:00:00	he has expressed his feelings not asked for your moral stand on this .I too don't agree with you.
2313	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I gave my views to him, so whats your problem? Nor i am giving any moral stand to anyone.
2314	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sadly, Police have not caught the wrong guy :( Police is involved in this cruel activity!! How would mob break into a jail with high security and pick the right person out??? Yes, but its true that the guy did not rape anybody.... Once again, public became puppets and committed such a sin :(
2315	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is not confirmed if the guy committed the crime or not. Though we should demand for the courts to work faster and hang the rapist within months of committing the crime but killing someone without the confirmation that they were the rapist or not is wrong. 50% of the reported rape cases in India are false as per the official findings.
2316	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What would you do if you seea  manr aping your sister? WOUld you not kill him? Legally, even if you have seen him, he is still innocent and you cannot touch him. So, according to you ,what should be done?  We have seen NIrbhaya case - where  is the punishment?
2317	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what would u do if ur brother is framed and not committed a rape in reality. later on hanged publicly without factual evidence. dimapur SP has already denied any  medical proof of rape.
2318	2015-03-09 00:00:00	When One is seeing that is a completely different story is it not? &lt;br/&gt;In this case the Public did not see the rape happening, they heard about it and that's completely different. &lt;br/&gt;I agree with the fact that the rapist of the Nirbhaya case should have been hanged long back and I still raise the demand that they be hanged immediately as their crime has been proven without any shadow of doubt. But that was not true in this case.
2319	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NOT AT ALL RIGHT. NO BODY OR GROUP OF PEOPLE HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE LAW INTO THEIR OWN  HANDS. JUNGLE RAJ CAN NOT BE ALLOWED IN A DEMOCRACY.
2320	2015-03-08 00:00:00	how could mob decide that he was rapist when medical report do not prove it,
2321	2015-03-08 00:00:00	tomorrow any lady blames u will u ask for justice or hand urself to mob
2322	2015-03-08 00:00:00	if it was only for rape why burn shops grow up
2323	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Narrated by Ibn Abbas: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; "I (Muhammad) put on her my shirt that she may wear the clothes of heaven, and I SLEPT with her in her coffin (grave) that I may lessen the pressure of the grave. She was the best of Allah?s creatures to me after Abu Talib"? The prophet was referring to Fatima , the mother of Ali. they learn it from the mother pigg buttock hangs on him (PBUH)--mohaMAD--ASTAGFIRULLAH
2324	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Above all, I cant trust Muzzies.... they can do anything possible... look at the data of criminals in India by religion, Muzzies top on it...
2325	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Tat list is from RSS police station not from actual police station. 200 rapes in delhi in last 20 days, and not even one muslim in conviction
2326	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Do you have a confirmation that there is not one minority member among the 200 rape accused in Delhi? have you seen the data? or have the released the data that way? no.
2327	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This kind of incident should have happen rite from the next rape case delhi rape,. there has been 200 rape cases in 90 days in delhi , any incident like these ?? no ! coz the accused was not from minority.
2328	2015-03-09 00:00:00	you mean to say that out of the 200 cases of rape in Delhi none of the accused are from Minority? Please don't spread communal-ism when there is none. &lt;br/&gt;The fact that this guy was a minority has played a role in the public's action, however mot every rape accused who is from a minority faces similar situations either.
2329	2015-03-08 00:00:00	they did the right thing but countries journalists and politicians want to feed kasabs and rapists and cry foul when something nasty happens stupids and label these guys as taliban.People of nagaland are capable of taking care of their own people.well done nagas
2330	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Right but the way in which he was killed was too gruesome. The visuals are too shocking. It is high time the center checks the illegal immigrants. They are polluting the whole eastern and NE region.
2331	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sir, that man was merely accused of rape. He was not tried for the crime &amp; he definitely was not convicted of it. You supporting his killing by a frenzied mob, means you are justifying murder!
2332	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So Illegal Bangladeshis roam free in the NE Sates many such cases are bound to happen!
2333	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You Maron, they are Bangladeshi, they are the sons of land. This is there ansectors birth place. He ( the accused) is innocent until proved guilty. Also read the police medical report has not proved the rape.
2334	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why are people agitated because of brutal killing...He brutally raped that girl did he do a Award winning job...Kill these BSTERSDS
2335	2015-03-08 00:00:00	So if you are in another community dominated area and get accussed, do you think your lynching based on accusation would be justified? By other I mean linguistic, casteist, ethnic or religious.
2336	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Stop pre-judging the matter as some reports indicate the medical report states no rape, so hold your horses. Tomorrow even you can be at the receiving end of a mob, if stranded in a hostile environment. The mob pre-judged the matter and its not just a casualty but  global embarassment now. By the way, this Muslim man's - not sure if he was guilty or not, as I won't pre-judge, unlike you, but wasn't a Bangladeshi. His entire family served in the Indian army with one brother martyred in Kargil. Father was in the air force. Had he not been Muslim, the headlines would have been about: The kin of Kargil martyr killed in mob justice over alleged rape! ...
2337	2015-03-08 00:00:00	( To indian Naik ) hello brother I am very sorry to inform you that you are going to  very ill soon.People say i have black tonque , and out of somewhere i am getting a feeling you or a person very close to you will be gravely ill.I am sorry brother but this will happen soon.Sorry Again.

2339	2015-03-08 00:00:00	BJP / RSS Sanghis were going around celebrating the death of a Bangladeshi immigrant and find out the victim was an Ex-IAF man's son and the brother of a brave Kargil martyr. What happened in Dimapur to an Indian national is not just anarchic, lawless but the first indicator of failure of the State under BJP Modi. Evidence of rape or not, lynch mob needs to be dealt with. No connection between whether accused was guilty and how mob rules &amp; mastermind were allowed in first place declaring accused as illegal migrant BD and then lynched him taking out from central Jail.Compete failure of law &amp; order system in State
2340	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Many women in India are nowadays making false rape charges. Every girl is not Nirbhaya. That guy's rape was not proved. The Naga girl might be in relationship with the guy. Nowadays several consensual sex is given the name of rape. Indian judiciary and police help out these gestures of women. Just one false rape charge - and police and lawyers mint money.  In actuality rape is difficult and very few rapes are really committed than what is reported. Police, media and courts are in business
2341	2015-03-08 00:00:00	martyrdom for rapist? coz he was a Bangladeshi?
2342	2015-03-08 00:00:00	You rasc*l of the highest order, why are you spreading lies knowing very well he was not a Bangladeshi? His father and two of his brothers were/are in the Indian army. Because of traitors like you India today is fragmented in the lines of caste, religion, language etc. May God save my country from scoundr*ls like you.
2343	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Can an army recruit Bangladeshi immigrant do you know army do back ground check before recruitment?
2344	2015-03-08 00:00:00	do you know Voter id card,Ration card,birth certificate are easily available with proper connection?and do you know the backgound check can reveal nothing if the illegal immigrants lives in Cachar/Karimgunj district simply because everybody there will say that person is from that place itself
2345	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is so? The Army personals are fools, appointing a person that to a Muslim like that. Army doesn't know about this things?
2346	2015-03-08 00:00:00	How sick human being are you. Lets say he was a Bangladeshi, is it ok to lynch without a fair trial. I hope some day a mob does not come after your son and daughter.
2347	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is proved that they murdered an innocent.
2348	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Those who support lynching, will they support the lynching of Nihal Chand too? After all both are rape accused.
2349	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Latest reports indicate that in med. examination rape was not proved.The members of the accused are/were all in indian army including his father.But the public labelled them as bangla deshi.This is not the way of rulr of law.Public should have waited , at least, for the result of the med. exam.If they had done so this inhuman incident had not taken place
2350	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ANY / ALL RAPIST/S MUST BE DEALT WITH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, THIS WILL CERTAINLY PROTECT OUR WOMEN WITH NO DOUBT.  BUT, NAGALAND CASE IS DIFFERENT, POLICE CONDUCTED MEDICAL TEST ON THE LADY AND THERE IS NO PROOF OF RAPE!. BE CAREFUL AND SENSITIVE ANY WOMEN COULD BLAME A MAN ON RAPE CHARGES IF WE DEAL IT IN A SILLY WAY. IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH SERIOUSNESS.  "RAPE IS NOT SUBSTANTIATED ON THIS LADY" SIRJI.
2351	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its a tragic incident and need to be scrutinised minutely, breaking into a central jail is a serious threat to the country. This is not just one isolated incident but a serious lapse on the part of the Administration. The man was a rapist or not need to be determined even more now that the mob has delivered the sentance in a very scary way. There were reports in the newspapers that there was no rape happened and it was a sheer case of ramsom. Dont know which version is correct but im definite that most of us want to know the truth
2352	2015-03-08 00:00:00	In MUMBAI Upper Caste girl gang rape case, Muslim convict photos are published in media; In DELHI Upper Caste girl gang rape case, Lower Caste convict photos are published in media; But in DABRA Lower Caste Untouchable Dalit girl gang rape case, Upper Caste convict photos are NOT published in media;
2353	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because the media is full of upper caste bigots. If lower caste want justice then they should own and run their media.
2354	2015-03-08 00:00:00	he was son and brother of military men, so he was indian and not bangladeshi, second thing he was married to naga women,the girl who complaint about rape was cousin of his wife, how can a person can rape many time to any girl for so many days, she was demanding 2 lakh rs from his wife, so it was not the case of rape , medical examination proves that rape was not done, second thing court has not declare him rapist, how could a mob can drag a person from jail and hundreds of police do nothing to save him, beacuse he was muslim, now can we demand same justice for gujrat and meerut rape case where culprits are not even arrested, if he was rapist so we demand same justice for all rapist of gujrat riot accused, and if he was not rapsit , then all killers should be treated like taerrorist for killing innocent person, or all kilers should be handed to muslim mob, so that justice can be done in few minutes, now will police hand over all killers to mob?
2355	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The Bictoms two Brothers are Serving in Assam Rifles which is Engaged in Counter Insurgency Operations in the North East. Definately the Naga Insurgent Groups are behind this. The Woman who Alleged Rape has been Tested Negative for any Sexual Assault.

2357	2015-03-08 00:00:00	India is full of anti Muslim people. I m Hindu and I am against the killing of the deceased. he was accused of rape n not rape convict. just because he is Muslim one should not kill him. even if he is from Bangladesh in d worst case scenario, then also he is a human being first. for these so called sick Indians with sick mentality for whom religion comes first humanity at last. n I don't see any difference between u sick ppl and ISIS
2358	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why only 15 arrests. I read that 10000 were involved.

2360	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This also reflects the callousness of the police and govts. in checking immigrants influx. like we have immigrants from Bangladesh, pakistan, nepal who cannot be distinguished from locals at times but there are other immigrants from few african countries, russia, UK etc who are into illegal businesses in Goa n nothing is being done to put a check on them n tgeir activities
2361	2015-03-08 00:00:00	All you people who support what this mob has done to this man are immature and sick in the head. Yes I'm all for brutal punishment of rapists and murderers and paedophiles BUT ONLY IF PROVED GUILTY! Already reports have arisen questioning the truth in the incident. Have you any idea how many women file false rape/molestation and dowry cases against men and their spouses?? There are thousands of selfish greedy and self-centered  women out there who misuse laws meant to protect them and you fools blindly support it without even thinking twice about if what they claim is true! Its as though you think that because she's a woman she can't be lying! Tell me would you have this same opinion if your father or brother was falsely accused and murdered because of some woman who wants revenge or money??!! In the future think properly before falsely judging an accused person of being guilty just so you can impress the women in your life and show them what a nice guy you are.
2362	2015-03-08 00:00:00	and people like you who want a fair trial of terrorists and rapists and want us to spent hard earned tax payers money to spend crores of rupees on security of kasab and his biryani and rapists like this one to be given food in jail and bbc will come and interview stupids and bring laurels to our nation I must say you are immature and sick in the head.people of nagaland did the right thing
2363	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Mr. Ramakrishna, with all due respect I really sincerely ask you to please do yourself and us here a favour and please leave this discussion as it is a place for intellectuals to exchange ideas and not for half wits like you to rant about non sense. Please read carefully what I had written previously and if the language was too difficult for you then ask some literate friend of yours for help. I specifically mentioned that I am all for severe punishment of rapists but only if they are found to be guilty. I can tell you must be very ignorant as you don't seem to be aware of how many women misuse and abuse laws meant to protect them. And then dimwits like you blindly support them to show them how nice and upright you are. If what the people of Nagaland did was right then they should do something like that to you and then I'd like to hear you say that what they did was the right thing. Please save yourself any further embarrassment and keep your fanatical views to yourself, moron. P.S. That s country is not functioning only on your Tax money, we too struggle morning to night to earn an honest living and pay our dues to the govt. That doesn't mean that any person falsely implicated of a crime should be punished without verifying the charges against him. And your dumb example of Kasab is befitting of a person with a level of intelligence such as yours. Kasab was guilty and there was video footage to prove it. He deserves to be hanged. But people with no evidence against them must be proved guilty.
2364	2015-03-08 00:00:00	But the problem is Kasab was hanged while convicted Kodnani is out on bail after a century of mass murders and eating biryani -vegetable ofcourse!
2365	2015-03-08 00:00:00	There is no more horrific crime than the lynching of an innocent man. If it turns out that the woman filed a false complaint of rape against Syed Farid Khan, then she should be given the same punishment as those involved in the lynching.

Now his sister-in-law filed a false rape case on him because rape case is more stronger than 498a. The dead body sent to mother and father but the his naga-wife sitting in naga did not accept his husband's dead body. Feminist media is hiding all these information. He was not a rapist. He is a victim of a false rape accusation. It can happen to you as well anytime the what will you do? You don't have to rape anyone. India is not safe for man because of these legal terrorist on men. how could mob decide that he was rapist when medical report do not prove it, MoreOver  Medical examination of the girl, who alleged rape, indicated that there had been no sexual assault....................

Please take it as a suggestion, if you care. Still  dont bring religious card here,people from nagaland are known to harass outsiders irrespective of their religion.
2369	2015-03-09 00:00:00	he has expressed his feelings not asked for your moral stand on this .I too don't agree with you. its time the so called Muslims should think seriously about it MoreOver  because the community is doing more atrocities around the world in the name of religion......

Police, hand and glove with the criminals did not even file a complaint from me. Just as people call gods in a helpless situation, I call upon all of you to help me save my life. Our government is making a mockery of the justice. And Mr. Gogoi...please do not forget his behaviour in Gauhati gang rape last year.
2384	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Home Ministry wants to punish people who killed the rapist. Home ministry should ask itself why the brutal inhuman killers of Nirbhya are still alive. Why there is not even a hearing for the last one yeat? Why it allowed that phirangi woman to make a disgusting film on Nirbhya? Jaya Bachan said rightly that why she did not make a documentary on her own rape case rather than coming to our country. DISGUSTING the way our government behaves. No self respect and dignity, no sense of justice. Justice is only for the criminals and not for the victims.

Saudi are so horrible that they punish the victim. Why because that draconian law called sharia want 4 male witness for a rape victim.

MoreOver  Narrated by Ibn Abbas: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; "I (Muhammad) put on her my shirt that she may wear the clothes of heaven, and I SLEPT with her in her coffin (grave) that I may lessen the pressure of the grave. She was the best of Allah?s creatures to me after Abu Talib"? The prophet was referring to Fatima , the mother of Ali. they learn it from the mother pigg buttock hangs on him (PBUH)--mohaMAD--ASTAGFIRULLAH

2395	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Lynch all bangladeshis in north east or elsewhere in India, that is the only way to prevent this illegal immigration and related law and order situation in India.
2396	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The govts are basically trying to prevent roiting by illegal immigrants and anti national muslims as for them the person killed was not a rapist but a muslim first.
2397	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dear Brother, lets not give this incident a communal angle. Your statement can also be said that he was killed by the mob because he was a Muslim first and an accused later ( Rape is still not established). Lets the law take its own course.
2398	2015-03-08 00:00:00	No clear picture of the story yet.
2399	2015-03-08 00:00:00	My dear Nagas, this is what you get when you decide to stay with the black hindu country. Your mother N sisters will be raped mercilessly, you will be called chinki and probably get beaten by mob in delhi. Why no join with your true brothers -china....
2400	2015-03-08 00:00:00	pliz dnt support a rapist cut his head off,,,,,
2401	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sachin Gupta; If the individual has committed the crime, then indeed he should been more severely punished. Reality is something, SAFFRON TERRORISTS wanted to killing the innocent Muslim, what shame these people bring to themselves, the religion they follow and their upbringing...
2402	2015-03-08 00:00:00	"Innocent muslim" where do you find them???
2403	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Look at your place, there are thousands. Take this incident as an example. Thousands of Hindus against one innocent Muslim...
2404	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Brother Lets not give this a communal angle. Let the law decide. This type of incident happens because of uneducated people on both communities, who are used by politicians for their own benefit.
2405	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A Nagaland Police official in Dimapur said efforts were on to identify those involved in the killing of Syed Farid Khan and that they would be brought to book soon.
2406	2015-03-08 00:00:00	One part of me is happy that the people gave immediate justice and the other part is scared to think where this would lead to....People pronouncing the accused as guilty and hanging them even before a trial....scary...
2407	2015-03-08 00:00:00	the seed of hatred is spreading from north east to the rest of the country.
2408	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I think this is the best way of punishment in India for RAPISTS.!

2410	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This incident a bad omen for the Govt. which is the custodian of law &amp; order, taking the same by citizen would lead to anarchy.
2411	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The lynching of the rapist from Dinapur Jail is a classical example of how  the mob will react when they lose patience &amp; are dissatisfied by the police &amp; judicial system in punishing the perpetrators of rape!They are sometimes released also for some technical reason!Rape incidents have not stopped or become infrequent even after enacting draconian laws! Of what use are Laws if not strictly implemented!Arrests of protests will not serve any purpose!
2412	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why protesting? do they support raping? shoot them.
2413	2015-03-08 00:00:00	outsource rapists to saudi arabia.  they know how to punish criminals much better that we do.
2414	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If lynching is allowed, then people who made false election promises are in danger.
2415	2015-03-08 00:00:00	MIND YOUR LANGUAGE....YOUR COMMMENT INDICATES THAT YOU ARE FILTHY PERSON.
2416	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Am happy to hear what they did. Police would have given him good food, protection and may be listened to his stories on how he raped. Very good judgement.
2417	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This incident is communal hatred, Punishment should be for Convict but not for the accused. These illiterates does not have any faith in judicial system and has belief in law and order.
2418	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If the govt does next to nothing peaple will take the law in their hands . I support the lynching . It will make rapists think twice ..
2419	2015-03-08 00:00:00	uncle...usse Kya hoga?
2420	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nobody personally against it because the Indian Judiciary takes time to give punishment to the culprit. The person who raped the young girl continuously for two days and he thought to have enjoyment. Also he might be thinking that even if he punished, there are enough loop holes for him to remain outside. But for the law, it has to go on its' course and should keep the order in the city.  Govt should note, there should be courts to punish culprits immediately on arrest otherwise this can spread across the country.
2421	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims should be punished as per Sharia laws for committing rapes on non-Muslims. Prophet allowed four wives to Muslims realizing that his people were sexual predators but this also was unable to control their criminal activities.
2422	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Very sad incident
2423	2015-03-08 00:00:00	what police and govt was doing? why he was handed over to mob? for hours he was paraded and police do nothing to save him, why? how can a mob decide who is rapsit when medical report deny it and court has not declared him rapsit?
2424	2015-03-08 00:00:00	They should have burned that rapist muslim alive just like their masters isis...bangla muslims are the most down trodden &amp; burden for the whole world...they are bunch of ugly uneducated &amp; over populated sub humans....
2425	2015-03-08 00:00:00	u just shut up....bloody asho..why r u comparing with isis....u go and join rss.best advice
2426	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What about the Nepalis, still practising polyandry. You have an apt name, only 'le' missing at the end
2427	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The lynching was clearly not as a punishment for rape. The police says there was no evidence if rape. Nagas are like kashmiris, they do not want outsiders in their midst but they want to be free to go where they want. A dangerous trend, beware India. Failure of judiciary is not the cause, you cant complete even investigation in a week. Then are we to presume the Nagas will lynch all accused whose cases are pending in the courts in nagaland. Who are you trying to fool? Gradually violence has been let loose, it wont stop with this incident
2428	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I cant trust Muzzies....
2429	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why is law arresting innocent and not punishing the criminals

2435	2015-03-08 00:00:00	These men are looking for license to rape

2438	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The girl herself claimed that the rapist bribed her. He really deserved it . Allah must be pleased with the mob.
2439	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Where's the NCW?It should press for the release of the persons who have done no sin but given a clear message to the rapists.
2440	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Protests against the lynching were reported from different parts of the state, including Karimganj, and a strict vigil was being maintained to prevent any untoward incident
2441	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Dimapur message. Stop all rapists. Else beware of the consequences.
2442	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Does this make sense? The mob did a good job to deter all future rapists.Dimapur showed a light.
2443	2015-03-08 00:00:00	On a General note, Why are muslim communities trying to fight for a man who has a wife, children and sleeping with another woman(whether its rape or not)?  What about the thousands of real innocent muslims getting killed in middle east for apparently no resons at all? Why not support them? Are they not your brothers?
2444	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Millions applauded the lynching. They should be released as a deterrent to all future rapists.
2445	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Many rape victims will weep reading this. They must be rewarded with gratitude. Does this not give us a weird message.  Love your rapist!
2446	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapists should be given capital punishment
2447	2015-03-08 00:00:00	hats off to those who did this..!! This should have been done earlier...
2448	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The saddest part of the story is that, the guy was not a rapist... Politics can be very cruel :(  Every day you will here a twist in the story and the truth will never come out! He was a victim. Now the people who lied should be punished the same way... including the girl! :( :(
2449	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist should be punished in public and beaten on his private parts to understand the kind of problem what a women suffers

2452	2015-03-08 00:00:00	INDIA IS WASTING A LOT ON UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR.  Penal Code is meant for punishing criminals after they are caught and proved guilty. Police force also uses man power for checking crime. BUT, INDIA SHOULD DEVISE MEANS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING CRIMINALS.
2453	2015-03-08 00:00:00	if he was rapist, then all rapist of gujarat and merrut riot case should be handed over to muslim mob by police, so that same treatment can be given to all rapist irrespective of community, if he was not , then all peoples who killed innocent muslim should be treated as terrorist and should be hanged like afzal guru and kassab,
2454	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is true that the rule of law must prevail. But, the people have begun to realize that the rulers and the law-enforcers are not doing enough to check crime.
2455	2015-03-08 00:00:00	They done a good job against culprit.
2456	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rapist became "Lynch Victim". So what? It's Karma....I do not support the arrests.
2457	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I think we should let law takes its own course. Rape is a horrendous crime but legal procedure has to be followed. Otherwise without rule of law we end up in anarchy.
2458	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I think 300 rapes in 2 months in Delhi tells us these rapists do not fear Law.
2459	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslim migration from Bangladesh on large scale to Assam and the neighboring NE states has been resented by the local communities like Bodo, Naga etc. We also see the same phenomena in Bengal. This migration has been promoted by the unscrupulous political parties primarily the Congress for the sake of votes. Now coupled with this background, the crime of rape is added and that turned out to be the tipping point. The local agitation against the illegal migration is in line with India's interest. Ignoring it, govt seems to pretend self righteousness and take action. This repressive measure will anger the population further and is likely to turn it against the govt.
2460	2015-03-08 00:00:00	the court should be deciding the verdict
2461	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sorry sir .. But before all that u shud take some strict actions on rapists... How can u make a rapist a celebrity ?? Disgusting laws we have .. Shame on our govt .. Tarun tejpal ,shekhar gupta n dr pranoy roy these are the biggest rapist in our country...without compromise no lady journalist can do work...pls hang them first
2462	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The bloody congress gifted India- great bangladeshi immigrants who are nothing but menace. Now, congress is trying to give it a communal.shade again, shame  on sickulars. A rapist deserve such kind of punishment
2463	2015-03-08 00:00:00	People should not attach the religion in this case....The legal system may not give verdict even after 40years or even release him without any sentence due to political pressure....One or two such incident may create  fear in the minds of  the fellow who wants to rape a girl...
2464	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nagaland has almost no Hindu population. Who were the people participated in lynching.  Why the congress cheif minister in Assam is giving a communal color. The secular parties like congress are thriving on communal agenda when such incidence take place.
2465	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The Judiciary especially the Judges, lawyers, Police and people related to justice system, should now wake up from their long sleep since independence.. This should be a wake up call for them if they want people to abide the legal system of the land. This particular incident shows that, people are getting restless with our justice system every passing day.. No one has right to take law in their hands, but because of the situation prevailed in the Nagaland, the people thought that justice may be denied to them, therefore they have done this whatever they have done... It may also be a conspiracy by pseudo sickulars, because the pseudo sickulars have already started playing community card. As long as the illegal migrants from Bangladesh are roaming freely in these border state, these problems will corp up every now and then.... Therefore, let the law takes it own course... everything will come out, the guilty will be punished for sure..
2466	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rape is a heinous crime all the culprit should be hanged in public, but it should be after the court has given its final verdict that the accused was the culprit. Law should be respected.
2467	2015-03-08 00:00:00	These people calling themselves "Bengali Muslims" are not that at all. A crime has been committed and the religion tag is being used to divert the focus from the main issue. Assam is infested with these illegal immigrants. But politicians encourage them coz of votebank. (I am from Assam)
2468	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is the result of continually allowing Bangladesh muslims by Leftist parties and now Mamta banerji into indian territory for vote purpose.  Do not be surprised if tomorrow demand for Bangladesh2 surfaces.
2469	2015-03-08 00:00:00	As expected there is more to than what meets the eye........the guy was an Indian and not Bangladeshi as we have been told....his father worked in Indian Army for 20 years...he was a rape accused...seems he was demanded to pay 2 lacs which he refused and landed with rape charge....finally had to go due to mob fury....wish the same fury falls on Nirbhaya case criminals
2470	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why media and every body making it anti muslim??? He could well me a Muslim but he was RAPIST. .. we need Dimapur people in Ahemadabad for this Chohaan guy... im a Hindu n want this guy to be given the same punishment for what he has done regardless of he belongs to my religion. ... same thing I would say just look at that guy as a criminal not Muslim
2471	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This guy and his family deserves to be kicked out of the country... Release the 15 who killed the rapist muslim guy... Its not the fault of his religion its the fault of his up bringing....

Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the real mega criminals living gaily Behind all these merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life a living hell in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and criminal human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like us and our kith and kin? What an irony of fate and travesty of justice That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, duped and coned us only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally uprooted and torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn Enduring endless daily agony and heartaches Too tragic, heart-rending and tear-drenched to be told Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their  creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Others have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives Despite all the anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to all Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizens? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!
2474	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Arrest sickulars instead
2475	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If court punishes him with severe judgement means why the people taking law in their hands.
2476	2015-03-08 00:00:00	how one can believe in judiciary when criminals &amp; corrupts like amar singh lalu yadav raja and likes where given bail. lynching of the rapist was correct.
2477	2015-03-08 00:00:00	a fair trial is must before any punishment. an innocent killed is worse than how much punishing 100 guilty is good.
2478	2015-03-08 00:00:00	as expected Muslims are giving communal look of the issue.  these Muslims are from Bangladesh infiltrated in assam on patting of our politicians. they should be lynched and body thrown into Bangladesh.
2479	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Too early for this kind of jusdgement by the PEOPLE! Law is there, why take into your hands? He is only accused waiting for trials and judgement. Not a good thing.
2480	2015-03-08 00:00:00	mob lynching is the most heinous crime ever possible. there is no guarantee that innocent can't be lynched by a mob led by people with ulterior motives. This is also known as riot.
2481	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Wishing all the indian ladies a very happy and safe women's day...i know you ladies are sitting among ugly neanderthals, i feel sorry for you.
2482	2015-03-08 00:00:00	People losing faith in judicial system which forced them to take the law into their hands. Look what Nirbhaya rape accused is doing now? He is cooly enjoying govt hospitality &amp; merrily gives interviews to international media.
2483	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If this was to be allowed then Nirbhaya killers would have been lynched by now. People have to have faith in judiciary else there would be jungle Raj  and all of us would no longer be living in a civilised society.
2484	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is the way forward..justice delayed is justice denied..this is after effects of how our system let the rapists, criminals, murderers, terrorists keep sitting in the jails forever and give them defense lawyers and opportunity to defend their acts or even worse airplane hijack or a party like PDP relasibg them in the context of no evidence.
2485	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why shud der be arrest...dis is goin to happen if there is delay in justice....indian judiciary it's a wake up call for u...this is the power of public...welcome to real democracy
2486	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Its sad to say, once the mob has done justice. But, the horror of out of control sex-crime on female members in India has gone up like wild fire over the past years and our governments or politicians of repute has done nothing serious enough to curb this barbaric crime. So, I think for once the mob rule has done justice ! Well done the public !  Jai Hind !
2487	2015-03-08 00:00:00	WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her poor ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished ans much yearned dream Yet you made sure she never bagged even that humble dream! Going to a movie with a kith when the night was still tender Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so good and tender Her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat Instead of bedecking her bridal chamber with blooms most fragrant and bright, sod! And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry loud and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-smeared parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream, sod! Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that agony-torn mummy Will scorch the earth? And you never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so sub-human to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains embedded in the intellect; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Heven is only a place on earth; you know not? Why you didn't  really know that even I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not Mind! But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you hear it or take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Unscrupulous hypocrite and stealer of all human happiness, was it too much to ask for?
2488	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sons of soil, Bengali speaking muslims that too in Assam. Are you seriously fooling us? Bangladeshis should be thrown back. Their country was not liberated by India in 1971 so that half of their population then comes to India over the next few decades. Whom to blame by Congress and sickulars. Long term effect of these Bangladeshis is yet to be felt. Just wait and watch.
2489	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Indian government should release the 14 suspects until the crime is really proven. Police has no right to arrest any one without any proof or witness and arrest should be with warrant. I demand government should release the arrested people.
2490	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Is this barbaric attitude makes India proud? We have accused BBC that they have been trying tarnish our “Great" culture... Is this the same "culture" we have been so proud?
2491	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This is exactly what BBC was trying to achieve , first to make a documentary like this and incite people and the Nagas thought in light of the current international accusations against India they can get away with the lynching. Now BBC will make a documentary on mob lynching problem in India.  I hope all of them involved in the lynching of this man get death penalty to send a message especially if it turns out the accused was innocent
2492	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Hail Nagaland!!
2493	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims these days are not just behaving like indian citizens. the love jihad has proved all over india how they give financial aid to boys to somehow lure other community girls n spoil their lives. When girls get acquainted with such paramours even the police n law cannot interfere if they r adults. but it is certain that the life of the girl is ruined. No one would disturb the love life of a couple but the incidents that have happened provokes. The problems of so called muslims even echoedin mumbai when they took a procession for protection of muslims in Burma n Assam n even kickedthe Amar Jawan memorial n grabbed the rifle from CST, Mumbai. No community in india would at any cost do such a dirty thing against motherland. Whatever has happened in Nagaland is sorrowful, but the other side of girl also has to be heard which the investigations could understand. In social work we have several muslim boys lure young girls drive them out of house n put them to grave conditions of sex or in brothel. these things are not brought out for public shame. These muslim boys even misbehaved with mumbai police women constables n destroyed cst station.
2494	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It brings shame to the constituency...
2495	2015-03-08 00:00:00	. where is the proof and evidence against these 14 ?
2496	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What if the person was framed under business rivalry and pushed into jail? Can this not happen to you? That is why a fair trial is a must before any kind of execution.
2497	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Whether Rape or Intrusion the Government must e ale to handle the matter diplomatically. Now 14 persons have been arrested in Connection with Dimapur Jail n attack............The government must be careful in this regard............Already there is UNREST&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;problematic .............kodeeswaran
2498	2015-03-08 00:00:00	illegal migrants are changing demography of NE states ,,,such cases only reflects people thoughts ,,,just not a solely punishing of a rapist
2499	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Rape...rape.... rape......vary disturbing news.Rapist don,t have daughter,sister and mother ???  But then lynching of a rape accused is also not good, we must respect the laws of the land.Some communalised  the issue is vary danger.
2500	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The delay in our legal system and delayed punishment leads people to take law in their hand. See the rapists in Delhi still living at the cost of our money and now enjoying as a celebrity.  soon some film makers will buy his story and he will be a hero soon.
2501	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nagaland CM and Police Chief should be killed for this criminal mobocracy.
2502	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Even if they are Thousands, they should be hanged. The victim was innocent.
2503	2015-03-08 00:00:00	When Muslims in India have their own personal law based on religion they should also follow the Sharia law for criminal punishment. The punishment as per Sharia for Rape is Stoning to death. This should be strictly followed as the Muslims want their law to be based on Religion.
2504	2015-03-08 00:00:00	India is not governed by gita or quran it is by constitution. Even according to sharia an ACCUSED cant be stoned to death.and according to constitution an accused is innocent until proven guilty.
2505	2015-03-08 00:00:00	rite..ppl dnt trust indian judiciary system.  so give rapists to public..they deserve thrashing. dragging. and get killed ..
2506	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Then people should fight to change judiciary not act like uncivilized barbaric tribals.
2507	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Knock knock he was just an ACCUSED
2508	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ONE PERSON NAMED E.M OYUO THE ADMIN OF A FACEBOOK PAGE INSTIGATED THIS FOR MANY DAYS PLEASE DON'T BLAME ALL PEOPLE OF NAGALAND FOR THIS. I feel ashamed this happened in Nagaland my state, but people need to understand it is not the nature of people here to do that, the real culprit behind the mob violence in dimapur that lynched a Muslim man was instigated for many days by E.M.Odyuo, the administator of a popular naga page " in Facebook which has been repeatedly posting articles against Muslim Assamese and immigrants in general and unrestrained comments which the adminstrator of this page allowed, which called for killings of Muslim Assamese and Bangladeshis in Nagaland.  During the mob violence E.M odyuo also was seen inciting physical violence against Muslim Assamese and immigrant minorities for them to be slaughtered. In his facebook page there is always hatred towards various people,other naga tribals, other people from other parts of India, Muslims, Hindus etc.
2509	2015-03-08 00:00:00	If other people of Nagaland listened to him and did not report him they are as guilty as him
2510	2015-03-08 00:00:00	90 per-cent of all crimes are committed in West Bengal by so called minority community, and everybody looks other way, because every political community want to prove that he is more secular than other, and when US based writer Abhijit Roy was hacked in Dhaka, no one in political community in Bengal raised his or her voice, what a shameful disposition.
2511	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Well wat abt the man who was lynched even though he was only an ACCUSED
2512	2015-03-08 00:00:00	I feel ashamed this happened in Nagaland my state, but people need to understand it is not the nature of people here to do that, the real culprit behind the mob violence in dimapur that lynched a Muslim man was instigated for many days by E.M.Odyuo, the administator of a popular naga page " in Facebook which has been repeatedly posting articles against Muslim Assamese and immigrants in general and unrestrained comments which the adminstrator of this page allowed, which called for killings of Muslim Assamese and Bangladeshis in Nagaland.

2513	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Government should make compulsory VISA for people from other countries.
2514	2015-03-08 00:00:00	where did this come from ?
2515	2015-03-08 00:00:00	bravo..well done Naga..
2516	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It would be nice to see the Nagas and the minorities settle their dispute once and for all. There will be peace after that.
2517	2015-03-08 00:00:00	This can be the mentality of people, when they feel that laws are not adequate to do justice to women. Take the case of the rapist in the Tihar Jail openly boasting before media that he and his mates have done right by raping the girl and killing her so brutally. He has no feeling of guilt at all. Our law is unable to change their mindsets nor prevent them from committing offences. How can our women get justice? How can they move freely on roads?
2518	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He was just an ACCUSED.
2519	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Article 15 in The Constitution Of India gives no protection to illegal immigrants of foreign nationals in India. It is applicable only among Indians, and if the person is Bangladeshi, than government has no say
2520	2015-03-08 00:00:00	not every bengali muslim is a bagladeshi. change ur mentality
2521	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Why were HIndu Bangalis driven out of what is  presently Bangladesh?
2522	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Ask that to the govt of bangladesh. Not me I am an indian citizen.
2523	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Don't worry guys..... basterds who raped are happily living in jail..... you will be released sooner.... a juvanile who pulls out organs out of a girl can be set out in just 3 yrs....... you people have given a justice to a girl who has been raped and tortured..... you people are great.....Thanks for providing right justice.....
2524	2015-03-08 00:00:00	knock knock he was just an ACCUSED.
2525	2015-03-08 00:00:00	On woman's day, we can and we should celebrate Malala Yousafzai's Nobel prize for single woman standing tall against all odds. In contrast, we are fighting tense situation in Assam and Nagaland, for mob lynching of a Rape Accused.  I thought Accused family, friends, relatives, knowns, fellow state, and fellow countryman will condemn his act, and disown him. but the situation is persons sympathetic to him is making a big big situation, making the entire area tense.  I wonder who are sympathetic to him???  Shame on him, and more to people sympathetic to a Rape Accused, a rapist.!!
2526	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Shame on you and also on your father for having given birth to an ignoramus. Either you are a fool who cannot comprehend English, or you are a downright r*scal. Have you not read reports, which have since been confirmed by the Assam C.M. Gogoi that there was no rape and the man was framed by a scheming and blackmailing woman, the so-called victim? Have you not read that the girl was the sister-in-law of the killed man, was in some kind of consensual relationship with him and was trying to blackmail him for a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs? People like you are no different from the Taliban or the ISIS and should be severely punished for encouraging people to break the law.
2527	2015-03-08 00:00:00	y? i said why? it means police n politicians are involved n want such case more n more..caward politician Mr rajnath give yr wife or daughter to the rapist on daily basis.
2528	2015-03-08 00:00:00	In india people are punished if they do the right thing and applauded and justified if you do wrong
2529	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The root cause of this problem is not this particular incident but the age old issue of non-locals ( Muslims, Bangladeshis and west-Bengal) encroaching local land and jobs. I wouldn't blame them if they are concerned that what happened to Kashmir pundits might happen to them as well. The first and foremost step Govt should take is to have a stronger border protection force to stop further illegal immigration. Second, they should instate laws to preserve the local culture which includes making it clear to the non-local population that they will have to live by the law of the land. What happened to the accused was wrong but we need to look at the actual cause behind it.
2530	2015-03-08 00:00:00	bjp government failed miserably
2531	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yea.....indian mentality is a sick one...!!! why supporting a rapist?????? the mob did the right thing
2532	2015-03-08 00:00:00	he was just an ACCUSED
2533	2015-03-08 00:00:00	All politicians are responsible for this attitude of people. Justice delayed is justice denied. Make an overhaul of our judiciary system to get justice within months, not years.
2534	2015-03-08 00:00:00	no matter of gravity of crime....if law and order is doing its action how can public take it in there hand....if publics starts behaving like so whole law and will sucumb....
2535	2015-03-08 00:00:00	These Bangladeshis are running amok in West Bengal causing all types of illegal activities including violence against women.
2536	2015-03-08 00:00:00	NOT EVERY BENGALI MUSLIM IS A BANGLADESHI. CHANGE UR MENTALITY. U R CALLING UR OWN BROTHERS FORIEGNERS
2537	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Just as that idiot cm of j&amp;k is going about following a fully muslim agenda, ignoring national interests and that of his own people (he's freed a terrorist) so these guys are fundamentalist muslims - they'll blatantly lie and cheat just to advance te cause of their stupid religion. I dislike all religions - for the proponents of superstition and blindf belief just seek to control the minds of the suggestible! But, islam takes the lead in perversion, aggression, violence and self entitlement! They are responsible for almost all the violence that is spreading cross the world. In conjunction with the united states' foreign policies that spells disastee-in-the-making for rhe world.
2538	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A true Muslim must set an example by his good deeds to the society -- A bad Muslim must quit Islam.
2539	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is unfair to arrest people and suspend SSP and DC in this case. This is not the failure of administration but the failure of judiciary. The courts take excessively long time in disposing of  the rape cases, which is the growing cause of discontent among the public. Even in Nirbhaya case, the convicts still are enjoying the hospitality of government and publicity by world media.
2540	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Most severe punishment must be given for a person who calls himself a Muslim and involves in crimes.
2541	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Even Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) would have given the same punishment for a rapist.
2542	2015-03-08 00:00:00	HE WAS AN ACCUSED..
2543	2015-03-08 00:00:00	How can anyone one support a rape accused.  Just because he is a muslim its insane. Mob lynching of rapist and thief is common in india.  why this media house is sounding like a spokesperson of rape accused.  Those commenting first read definition of rape in indian constitution.  its not your islamic definition were woman need to be crying beating chest with injuries marks . Moron even a wife can file a rape charge on husband.  its all about violation of someone will and trust and emotional hurt.
2544	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Shame on you and your father for having given birth to an ignoramus. Either you are a fool who cannot comprehend English, or you are a downright r*scal. Have you not read reports, which have since been confirmed by the Assam C.M. Gogoi that there was no rape and the man was framed by a scheming and blackmailing woman, the so-called victim? Have you not read reports or seen TV footage that the girl was the sister-in-law of the killed man, was in some kind of consensual relationship with him and was trying to blackmail him for a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs? People like you who support mob lynching are no different from the Taliban or the ISIS and should be severely punished for encouraging people to break the law. As for calling others morons - well, you the king of all morons, what the f do you understand of Indian law? Yes, no doubt a wife can file a rape charge against her husband. But Indian law does not PUNISH the husband until and unless the charge is proved. In this case, the charge was not proved. Got it, you SOB?
2545	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Stop pre-judging the matter as some reports indicate the medical report states no rape, so hold your horses. Tomorrow even you can be at the receiving end of a mob, if stranded in a hostile environment. The mob pre-judged the matter and its not just a casualty but  global embarassment now. By the way, this Muslim man's - not sure if he was guilty or not, as I won't pre-judge, unlike you, but wasn't a Bangladeshi. His entire family served in the Indian army with one brother martyred in Kargil. Father was in the air force. Had he not been Muslim, the headlines would have been about: The kin of Kargil martyr killed in mob justice over alleged rape! !
2546	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Because this mob justice means that nobody is safe if accussed like this  in a 'other' community dominated area. That other can be anything btw.
2547	2015-03-08 00:00:00	very good,, gave the right medicine at the right time. fantastic
2548	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Govts should make stringent laws that this will not happen again......because this is the outburst of Poor people against the crime against them in particular and against women in general....
2549	2015-03-08 00:00:00	ACCUSED MAN CANT BE SENTENCED
2550	2015-03-08 00:00:00	As per Quran and Shariah, the punishment for a rapist is death by lynching and stoning.
2551	2015-03-08 00:00:00	What happen if there wouldn't be any Partition Whole NE had ruled by Muslims...Thanks to Jinnah saab
2552	2015-03-08 00:00:00	why this media house sound like a spokesperson of rape accused. were is girls statement in her defence . while other media house do have put girls statement this media house choose to be a sicular.  I always say never rely on this media house for any news do check other for same news because this media house often mislead people.
2553	2015-03-08 00:00:00	WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream!

Was it too much to ask for?
2554	2015-03-08 00:00:00	HE IS JUST ACCUSED.....
2555	2015-03-08 00:00:00	They did the right thing by punishing the man. BTW, a muslim being 'son of Indian soil' is surprising.. converts just for a few titbits from arab masters!
2556	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Muslims have problem with idol worship but they have no problem when their Hadith Shahih Muslim talks about talking trees &amp; stones (Yes you read it correct, talking trees &amp; stones). You only have to read in book 41, number 6985 of "Sahih Muslim", the second-most reliable hadith (biographical notes of Mohammad, pls. Google search), that Mohammed himself believed that trees and stones would talk to Muslims: "Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger as saying: The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews." I literally rolled on the floor laughing upon reading this. This should also explain why the Arabs &amp; the muslims in general hate jews &amp; Israel so much.
2557	2015-03-08 00:00:00	if they want justice they can go to any muslim country like Bangladesh or Pakistan
2558	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Bangladeshi being aliens no normal fundamental rights should be given to them. As such killing or these people and that too heinous criminals should not cause any police case. BJP will be fked if they try to appease these people like Congress.
2559	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Is this to show the DM explusion and Jailors suspension is right or what the people have done justice is wrong. This is the fastest trial of rape convict ever in India
2560	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Sensitive matter.. Kindly do not  politicize the issue. We need to take stern step for the protection of women and girl child.
2561	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is proved that they murdered an innocent.  Now it is the turn of Police General and Home Minister. Without  doubt they should be hanged!
2562	2015-03-08 00:00:00	The whole NE is messed up with the rift between the native and the outsiders, especially the Muslim Bengali population (both Bangladeshi immigrant and domiciled ones)
2563	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Alarming. There should be adherence to rule of the land.
2564	2015-03-08 00:00:00	remove the muslims from north east state.  they are supporting rapists !
2565	2015-03-08 00:00:00	They did the right thing by punishing the man. Why did not govt force police the arrest those who killed Hindus in Kerala recently? why did not govt force police arresting those who hit the boys for celebrating Holi in Kerala? But if a Muslim rapist is dead, arrests happen. Why? Media also silent on the rest of issues.
2566	2015-03-08 00:00:00	He got the punishment he deserved for his crime. Why is there such drama? The only reason govt is acting is because they want to appease the muslims.
2567	2015-03-08 00:00:00	It is high time for the judiciary to tighten the cases of this sort. All over the country the rape cases are increasing and in many cases the victims are brutally murdered after rape. The usual criminal case procedure will never help these and as the days go on the people are getting more and more agitated for the inaction. A classical example is the NIrbhaya case and the accused are in jain even now. The mentality of one was made clear by the interview conducted by media correspondent. He has absolutely no regret for what he has done and still prepared to repeat it if situation permits. Not only that he ridicule the whole female community for their attitude, Why such fellows are kept in jail so long and many think capital punishment is not the solution for the crime.But leaving these fellows free will not be the biggest crime than hanging him to death by the judicial process.
2568	2015-03-08 00:00:00	All Bangladeshi have come in support of their rapist brother. Govt. should give free hand to the local tribes to fk out the Bangladeshi's from whole of North-East. BJP has only one chance to undo the historic wrong done by the Congress.
2569	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Nice work by Naga people...! Throw away these Bangladeshis before any more such incidents happen...!
2570	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Now the Muslim rights group are making this incident look like a xenophobic attack. This happens only when the law and order is not strict and people lose  faith in that.
2571	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Good things rarely happen. The mass did the right thing by lynching to death the criminal. In such cases government should 'not be able to find' those who executed the culprit.
2572	2015-03-08 00:00:00	WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR? Was it too much to ask for? You could have granted her her simple dream! After all, she had a heart of gold was going to be a doc A hospital in her ancestral village was her only dream And after just six months she was going to be a doc After endless toil and turmoil she was just a heartbeat away from her dream And finally going to fulfill that fondly cherished dream Yet you made sure she never materialized her dream Going to a movie with a buddy when the night was still young Was her only crime; I don't get at all why those whom gods love die so young And you gave one so young her inferno and in her death bed a tear-scorched throat And for that you shall surely in another inferno fry till you cry and rot Matters not even if you are God Almighty himself or not This you know not? You made her mumble her sorrow-drenched parting words: "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Before you finally blighted her life and blasted her dream Have you no heart, soul or eyes; know not how much it hurts a mummy? Saw you not the tears of fire felled for her only born babe by that poor mummy? Know not the truth that the red hot curses from that devastated mummy Will scorch the earth? You never even said sorry to that bereaved mummy! Still are you so heartless to have deprived her of her only life and dream? A question still remains; why was she granted not A glimpse of heaven instead and that pet dream? Why you didn't I know not As you despite repeated queries answered me not But, from the dying embers and ashes of her funeral pyre will sprout A million Nirbhayas and forever and ever rout The beasts and evil systems that rob her and her ilk many an innocent life, love and dream This I know; but, my time in bootless enterprises I shall waste not Therefore in stark protest I shall not recite my Gayathri tonight; like it or not I don't care either whether you take a hike now or not And besides, my last question I shall ask you not Even though, even now I honestly know not Why you didn't grant her her simple and innocent mundane dream! Was it too much to ask for?
2573	2015-03-08 00:00:00	A REQUIEM FOR NIRBHAYA "I'm sorry, mummy, I've given you only trouble; I'm sorry mummy!" Nirbhaya frailly mumbled and embarked on a journey You and I know nothing of Angel, in your innocent orisons, pardon all our cardianal sins! But let us all now Remember Those who blighted her life and blasted her dream Are only minor fries and nothing more They will hang now and be no more But, what about the mega thugs, super criminals and ultra anarchists Behind all these comparatively merely minor criminals roaming freely Making life more and more difficult in all possible ways and manners That only the most perverted and sick human mind can contrive, For all decent, honest and good citizens like you and me and our kith and kin? What a travesty of justice and fair play That they should be our rulers 1947-2015 And not prisoners? Remember They looted, plundered and pilfered only because we let them do it uninterrupted And they reduced the richest country on earth into the poorest, an oligarchic kleptocracy Mafiacracy, syndicracy, jokeplacracy, lootpalcracy, lunatic asylim and wasteland Fit only for bums, bounders and buccaneers to live in! USD 300 trillion is the guesstimated sum they looted until 2015. Remember Generations of very decent, honest, highly competent and good Citizens, including many I know and myself, have been driven away From their beloved motherland, city, town, village, hamlet, Hearth and home and brutally torn away From their near and dear ones And dumped in fiercely xenophobic foreign lands forlorn As a direct result! Remember More than six hundred million Indians Languishing under grinding poverty and penury are their direct creations and victims. Millions have been murdered quite unnecessarily or forced to commit suicide Thousands of truly qualified others Have been forced to stand aside or sidelined To make all their heinous crimes against India and Indians possible Remember It is the biggest heist ever in human history! Remember India is the most corrupt and mismanaged democracy on earth today! It is the biggest miracle ever on earth that India still survives as a nation Despite all the anti-India and anti-Indian jokepalers and lootpalers 1947-2015 And their never-ending and ever-growing tyranny and oppression All the water in the Holy Ganga and all the Seven Seas Will not suffice to cleanse their hands of the blood Of millions of innocent Indian citizens. No orison and mantra on earth is potent enough To absolve them of their multitudinous endless and boundless sins and crimes. When will they be amply punished and justice meted out to each and every Basically very decent, honest and good Indian citizen? When will that  glorious golden day of truth, justice and fair play dawn on India? And when will India thus become really free and independent? Then - and then only - Nirbhaya and millions of innocent others Will not have sacrificed their precious lives and dreams in vain Let's all now remember!
2574	2015-03-08 00:00:00	yes, it is time the revolution starts against rape. if the govt body do not act in time and action, yes this will happen.  no need to blame the common man...  also all these people who run into raping should be aware of this, believe me common blood is already boiled up....you cannot stop them from attending to these types of action any more  beware...beware...beware.... commons are changing... here we should not differentiate between religion....
2575	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This act though unfortunate shows the people having no faith in slow and incompetent judiciary. If people do not get fast and correct justice, people will take law into their hand and not wait 5-10 years for judgement.
2576	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I think 5-9 years is for the lucky ones. What about the victims or Delhi Riots and Godhra? They've been waiting for 20-30 years. Reports and more reports and SITs and what not. But nothing is every done.
2577	2015-03-09 00:00:00	whoever disliked ur comment is a lunatic
2578	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Yes in Godhra Ahmed Patel of Congress party with the assistance of Pakistani isi and his fellow Muslims burned train full of people. We are still waiting for Justice.
2579	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What about the justices for best bakery case....  Its not that only Hindu are waiting for justices Even Muslim are there...  OUR PM was involved in false encounter... JUSTICES should be equal dont divide in religion....
2580	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Vegetarians deciding which meat Non-vegetarians should eat... Bachelors deciding how many kids women should produce... Straights deciding on limits of gay lovemaking...

Rapists commenting on the morality of girls they rape and murder... India... Indeed...
2581	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Yes, most are hypocrites!
2582	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yup... Why don't people learn to rectify themselves first rather on moral policing and giving unwanted advice!!
2583	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Accurate description of make believe nation.

2585	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Relax... Save your angst for betterment of the country you live in and I can assure you that you r wrong...regarding intelligence!!
2586	2015-03-09 00:00:00	with the copy paste job of yours I think I am right about your intelligence. Intelligence is not how many professional degrees you have.
2587	2015-03-10 00:00:00	U got problem with me copy and pasting my own comment ... Sir?? God Bless you!!
2588	2015-03-09 00:00:00	there is serious anti hindu tone in your original post...&lt;br/&gt;
2589	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Great..some people will bring religion into everything.. May GOD bless you!!
2590	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Who ever wrote this missed some very serious phrases ------ "1. people vote in the name of religion and caste but still it is called as a democratic country". "2. The communal religions are called as seculars for getting the votes but still it is called as a democratic country".
2591	2015-03-09 00:00:00	3. we dont caste our vote but we vote for our caste
2592	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yeah.. Please add more... This list was not meant or labelled as complete... Everyone is welcome to add in..
2593	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Nagaland bloquea internet, impone toque de queda
2594	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If the medical report confirms that she is raped then the people don't have the right to provide "special treatment" to the rapist! and protesting in support of him! yes I agree the public act was not laudible yet there has to be someone to make a move. who knew that it would turn out ugly and  its a lesson to all the rapist in India to have a second thought before raping any innocent girl!
2595	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What the case really investigated properly
2596	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why Muslims are crying foul when the Muslim man, who was accused of raping the local girl was punished as per Islamic Sharia law. Every Muslim rapist must be punished as per Sharia only.
2597	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Rightly said
2598	2015-03-09 00:00:00	he was just an accused; islam delivers such verdict on being convicted. And now everyone rrested will be convicts and not accused..
2599	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Now he is proved as the rapist. If not guilty it is wrong..I agree.
2600	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What about the Hindus? How should they be punished?
2601	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Indian law is dealing with all others, but muslim want Sharia..all over the world, let us start with rape for Muslim. When a Muslim want to pray 5 times, eat beef, not eat pork, marry 3 times, ....all as per Islam, why not the death penalty after rape or beheading.
2602	2015-03-09 00:00:00	And indian politicians allow making laws based on religions? Why? To buy votes.
2603	2015-03-09 00:00:00	great done!! now it's confirmed that pig had raped d girl!! so Naga shuld felt proud of their act!!!
2604	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Was he really the culprit
2605	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Secular has died so there is going to be huge hula balo, it is possible that we may see some agitations in big cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad....
2606	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.
2607	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Surely this is not judicial system India is having to "kill" culprit openly. Then here is no difference between middle east and India in the human rights and judicial system.
2608	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Public should not be allowed to become judges
2609	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The government must now ensure that there is no civil strife in Nagaland.  What a shameless man to have raped his wife's cousin !  He certainly deserved the treatment meted out to him by the angry students.
2610	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I feel sorry for Khan's wife. Because of her cousin's alleged rape, her Husband was killed. Now her situation among her husband's family/society of be very precarious. This incident has wider ramifications to inter-caste marriages India.
2611	2015-03-09 00:00:00	As she is married to a Muslims, she will be taken care by husbands brother, father etc. She now belongs to the house and will serve the house.
2612	2015-03-10 00:00:00	रेपिस्ट को मार देना चाहिये. समाज मे ऐसे लोगों की कोई जगह नेहीं है. कोई कैसे रेप कर सकता है? सोच भी कैसे सकता है? सरकार क्या कर रही है? कानून क्या कर रही है? ऐसे लोगों के मन में इतना डर पैदा कर दो की सपने भी रेप करने के लिये सोच नहीं सकते. तड़पा तड़पा कर मारो ऐसे लोगों को. लाइव टेलीकास्ट करो हर चनेल पर. तभी ऐसे लोगों के मन में खौफ पैदा होगा और समाज में हम चैन से रह सकेंगे.
2613	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Give Justices then there will not be any need for curfew.....
2614	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.
2615	2015-03-09 00:00:00	All love failures can lead to rape cases....!!!!. Is it this is rape or mutual  ..? if this was a rape then why there is allegations amount Cash Dealings with the offender ? then what  is relation with  the TV  CCTV images that the rapist and the victim   make close gatherings ? (there are such reports  i read in  some media) All love failures can lead to rape cases.....and people who supporting this heinous crime may can also have a chance to  be felt in this type of trap !!!suddenlly the MAD crowd will make the so called justice system !!!
2616	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Afraid to take your Caste share of land and build your own nation as per "Communal Award"? Google "India's Caste Culture is a Rape Culture";
2617	2015-03-09 00:00:00	GUWAHATI: The Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.
2618	2015-03-09 00:00:00	He was not a muslim.. He was a rapist.. Politicians are using this for their own advantage.. This should be done in every state. . Rape is worse than murder... This is inevitable

2620	2015-03-09 00:00:00	shame of nagaland who killed a innocent  Muslim. guy.....The state should declare him a warrior. SHAHEED
2621	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Last time I checked, "shaheed" is a term used for martyrs who died or gave up their lives for a noble cause.  Idiot!
2622	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I think 5-9 years is for the lucky ones. What about the victims or Delhi Riots and Godhra? They've been waiting for 20-30 years. Reports and more reports and SITs and what not. But nothing is every done. .....
2623	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Had the Victim been a Muslim and the Accused a Hindu or some thing the Story would have been Totally Different . It would have been Consential Sex and not Rape . These are the state of Affairs in this Ram Rajya .
2624	2015-03-09 00:00:00	We have asked service providers to block all internet and mobile data services from 6pm on Saturday for 48 hours," Nagaland Police Dimapur range IGP Wabang Jamir said. "We want to stop circulation of the images and videos of the lynching, as these might escalate tensions."
2625	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The hue and cry based on religion should be ashamed to note that a muslim can rape a women twice and they cry of insecurity in india. No mob does anything foolish except for a deliberate reason. Some muslim beggar babas touch all types of women with peacock feathers in guise of blessing n begging. Do any hindu saint or beggar touch a burqa clad women in name of god ? The guy was married then why this extra step of immoral life perhaps their religion can absorb her as one of the wives made people angry. In kalwa thane district a muslim priest raped a 13 yr old girl n killed her when she was pregnant. The police arrested him on inquiry but the local mulims staged protest against the police. But a clogged drainage was found ta have chopped human flesh proved that the muslim priest tried to dispose the body through drainge. The same group later came to kill him but was taken into safe police custody. Its a call to all that law should not be manipulated to dilute n accommodate criminals n their acts.
2626	2015-03-09 00:00:00	he is not Muslim... he is rapist... first time a rapist has got a deserving punishment in India. Stop supporting him if u r a real Muslim.
2627	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What is he really the culprit or this was a conspiracy
2628	2015-03-09 00:00:00	People should revolt against the Congress govt. which is trying to punish the common people who punished a serial rapist from Bangladesh.
2629	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The current justice system is very slow and insufficient to deal with the vengeful anger in the people who make up the society. I believe the people of Nagaland have shown what the most swift and straight forward course of justice is, if justice is about righting the wrong committed in society then the society as a whole has acted against the criminal and cleansed him off the world. This can be considered as venting out of anger but when the governing bodies are inactive, it is only then that the society raises to take care of matters by themselves.
2630	2015-03-09 00:00:00	it's not proper the way Nagaland has conducted it's affair so far. . in the eyes of the world it has not brought down its own image but also India ' s precarious 60 years of independence and democracy it preaches. . .  pramok
2631	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why does this happen?
2632	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It took us more than 45-50 years to bring a semblance of peace in Nagaland and for God's sake the politicians should not unnecessarily create confusion in the minds of the Naga people .Else we would again go back to the olden days of the Nehroo-Indira Gandee days !! Just remember and understand killing/lynching may not be right but the mob mentality  was over powering ! The courts and the GoI has to understand this sooner the better,.
2633	2015-03-09 00:00:00	first time rapist hv got such worthy punishment in india....that shud create some fear in potential swines aka rapists
2634	2015-03-09 00:00:00	E.M ODYUO the administrator of a naga facebook page with over 60,000 members has been spreading inter-community hate in north east for sometime both against Muslim and Hindus and other Naga communities the central government should arrest this man or take action on him. many people have seen his page that got lot of hate message towards Indian Hindu mainlander and Muslims both Indian and Bangladeshi. We want our state to be free of illegal migrants but we don't want violence the way Mr. E.M ODYUO has been promoting against Muslims through his page with 60,000 readers.
2635	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Was he really the culprit. It was his wife again she was from Naga communinity and raping his friend is really a fishy story. The report could be also fake
2636	2015-03-09 00:00:00	E.M ODYUO the administrator of a naga facebook page is the one who instigated killings against Bangladeshi and Mainlanders. His facebook page with follower of 60,000 nagas has been instigating racial hatred against various other community in north east, Hindu mainlanders and Muslims equally for many months and years with hate posts put on that page. He instigated this crowd to lynch Bangladeshis. Most of us feel ashamed that our entire state is shamed thanks to this foolish person. Complaints are put towards Home ministry, police, NIA towards E.M odyuo who instigated these killing  and organized the mobs via social media and our entire state is blamed.
2637	2015-03-09 00:00:00	horrible to see some rapist Muslim in this forum supporting the rapist Khan....
2638	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Are you sure that India is still a democracy? Govt is violating rights (freedom of speech and press) of every citizen in that city/town and that is okay? Oh wait it never was a democracy.  I think govt MPs and MLAs are probably worried that they'll be doing the same to the corrupt Netas in the national capital and other places since Indian Judicial System doesn't work and they are above the law anyway.
2639	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Nagaland the best way to end the rape menace in India. We are proud of Dimapur.
2640	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Nagaland did a marvellous job. See Ludhiana tragedy. All those arrested should be released ASAP.
2641	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Assam Muslim Students Union appear to be working against the basic tenets of Islam which advocates stoning and lashing of a rapist. It is agreed that in Democracy, rule of Law prevails and no body is allowed to take law into its hands ; BUT when an issue is raised on religious plateform, the tenets of that religion must be honored. As on day, and as per press reports , it is one out of three rape cases, where rapist is punished - two go free. What is the solution the solution to deal with this problem. People are now fed up with this kind of criminality and if they take law in their own hands, they are not to be blamed.
2642	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Naga Land Govt. has stopped internet services only to maintain security for stopping any kind of remours.
2643	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Whatever the provocation, people have no right to decide punishment on fellow citizen
2644	2015-03-09 00:00:00	All those protesting the killing of the rapist prove that the community supports rape and are also rapist.. I am sure the same community did not protest when the incident happened in support of the victim...Shows their mentality... This is result of the govt policies who have not bothered about crimes against women.. The recent beef ban  shows that cows &amp; buffaloes are safer than women... with the punishment being 5 years
2645	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Uncivilized action by the mob
2646	2015-03-09 00:00:00	good
2647	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Eat dog meat and keep barking like dog. Junglee people.
2648	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If medical report is conform then no need to support them
2649	2015-03-09 00:00:00	if it is a rape then i would say..well done....
2650	2015-03-09 00:00:00	he Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.
2651	2015-03-09 00:00:00	People don't have faith in government, Who ever he may be he needs punishment, What ever people did is that's correct and fantastic.
2652	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Throw all Babgladeshi muslims out, y is govt. so slow to realise this??????
2653	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What a shame!
2654	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Rest of Bharat is with Nagaland
2655	2015-03-09 00:00:00	These kind of coercive measures by the Nagaland government will never work.
2656	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Lynching of the rapist was a blunder for the people. Now it signals how law and order is pathetic there. Govt must do all efforts to control anarchy in Nagaland.
2657	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The rapist got the death he deserved! Politicians doing what they do in such circumstances. Get political gains!
2658	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Delay in justice makes this crime so frequent.
2659	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Twenty-two people have so far been arrested for their alleged involvement in the lynching of a rape accused in Nagaland's Dimapur town, officials said on Sunday.  The government also blocked SMS and MMS services across the state in a move to control the social media, which had seemingly played a role in instigating the mob for the violence.  An irate mob had broken into the central jail in Dimapur on Thursday, dragged out the rape accused, stripped him naked and paraded him in the streets and finally brutally thrashed him to death.      "A total of 22 people have been arrested so far for their involvement in the death of rape accused Syed Farid Khan. We are examining video footage and more arrests are likely," said a senior official of the Dimapur administration.  Syed Farid Khan, a 35-year-old second-hand car dealer, was accused of raping a 20-year-old Naga woman on February 23 and 24 at different locations. Police arrested Khan on February 25 and a lower court sent him to judicial custody. On March 5, an irate crowd dragged him out of jail and lynched him.  Curfew has been imposed in the town from 3 p.m. till midnight. All security measures are being taken. "We are going to continue with the night curfew till substantial improvement of the situation," said the official.  The Nagaland government asked the telecom department to block SMS and MMS services across the state and it was done immediately.  The restriction will continue till further instructions.  Although telephone and internet services continued, the services were erratic.  The Nagaland government had suspended three top officials including the police superintendent, the deputy commissioner and jail superintendent of Dimapur for their failure to handle the situation and ordered a judicial probe into the incident.  Meanwhile, a 12-hour bandh called by civil society organisations to protest against the brutal killing affected normal life in Assam's Barak Valley districts.  Protestors blocked many roads in Barak Valley, leading to problems in vehicular movement. There was, however, no major untoward incident.  Khan's body was on Sunday buried in his native village Bosla near Badarpur town in Karimganj district amid tight security.  Nagaland authorities had handed over Khan's body to his family in Khatkhati area on the Assam-Nagaland border on Saturday. The body was later taken to his native village.
2660	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why are you re-talecasting the message
2661	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.
2662	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What kind of democracy and freedom to protest even again most corrupt and efficient bureaucracy,  ineffective judicial system.?
2663	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Whatever excuses people give that it was night, she shouldn't have been there, It is not a race crime, its one of a crime or the situation in India is more worse, but one thing everyone forgets that West and Australia are referred as developed places, and life there is taken as more safe and secure. What type of development we talk when we cannot provide a person a safe walk way at 9:00PM to return back from work. Is development just material or structural rather than all inclusive. Such Incidents are definitely a Shame for developed societies. We need to ponder and think that what more could be done to make World more safer at any time of the day and at any place of our World rather than boasting on our material gains and development.
2664	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Samir M.

2672	2015-03-09 00:00:00	NAGAs don't have brains..
2673	2015-03-09 00:00:00	how could you make such absurd comment and exposing your dumbness?

2680	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The girl had accused him of raping..
2681	2015-03-09 00:00:00	In Nagaland, How the Central Security forces controlled jail authorities handed over the convict to the Mob ? There are 7000 cases of Rape and Human Rights abuses pending in Courts of north east and they have to pick a lone Muslim Rape accused and lynch him. After the accused was lynched at City square the Police came into the scene fired a few shots in the air and disbursed the crowd and took the body away. This definitely smacks of some well planned political involvement and the BJP at center has some answering to do !!----Pro BJP, Pro Rss, Corporate owned and controlled media is great. They have succeeded in projecting all Muslims living in the North East as illegal Bangladeshi immigrant and Muslims living in mainland India as pro Pakistan, Anti India, Anti national, Anti Hindu, Communal, rapist  etc etc with their false and biased reportage.... This is actually another form of Racism and discrimination practiced in India against the minorities.
2682	2015-03-09 00:00:00	yes, absolutely. as per Koran, all Muslims are innocent. world is always conspiring against them.
2683	2015-03-09 00:00:00	for everything, you criticize the central govt.... even for supporting a rapist!!! in think all rapists in india should get the same treatment, irrespective of their religion.
2684	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Lynching of the rapist was a blunder for the people. Now it signals how law and order is pathetic there. Govt must do all efforts to control anarchy in Nagaland@@
2685	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Giving birth to you was a blunder by your Mother..

2692	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Same comments by different people..or one idiot mussy trying to create sympathy for another one..using Hindu names..
2693	2015-03-09 00:00:00	there must be an indipendent CBI inquiry  on medical test of the girl
2694	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SS must be appreciated if they have spoken the heart of millions of people.
2695	2015-03-10 00:00:00	no one knows whether the guy really raped her or not...what happens when medicals come and tell he wasnt the real rapist&gt;??
2696	2015-03-10 00:00:00	SHIV  SENA  IS  ONLY  SUPPORTED  BY  IGNORANT  COWARDS  LIKE  YOU .
2697	2015-03-09 00:00:00	when will Asaram Bapu will be lynched like that
2698	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I am also looking forward to it
2699	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Some people still believe that he was not guilty...some say he will come out soon...
2700	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Lets lynch the Sadhu who raped a California woman etc etc. The law must be applied to all . The IQ of the RSS is always suspect, they also have a narrow view of the world
2701	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Lets lynch this imam in Pakistan who did this to her wife. If anyone deserves lynching it's this imam  Zainab Noor, a young rural woman, was brutalized by her husband in a manner that shocked people across Pakistan and the world. Since he was an imam in a mosque, the crime acquired a particularly sharp dimension. Doctors treating Zainab Noor said her husband subjected her to vaginal electrocution, a new term in the lexicon of criminology. What did she do to be thus punished? It turned out that she wanted to escape a life of endless physical abuse, so her husband tied her to a bed and shoved a metal wire with 220 voltage in her. Miraculously, she survived.
2702	2015-03-10 00:00:00	First Muzzies....
2703	2015-03-10 00:00:00	BY  MUZZIES  DO  YOU  MEAN  YOURSELF  MANOJ .
2704	2015-03-10 00:00:00	OMG, is this  what millions of people want? Remember, he was only accused. Why do civilized countries have courts? The guilt has to be proven with evidence. Any angry jilted girlfriend can accuse an innocent man of rape. How do we protect innocent persons from being falsely punished?? Dear India, we have laws which need to be followed. Any one of us can be falsely accused or by mistakes.
2705	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why nambiar was not lynched?? In a major embarrassment for Shiv Sena, the party's 62-year-old deputy president Vasudev Nambiar has been arrested for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl for the past many months, as per reports on Sunday.   According to the police, the matter came to light when the victim delivered a premature baby at a local hospital in Mira Road. On questioning she revealed that she was being raped by Nambiar since January.  The accused took the girl out several times with him on the pretext of visit to the temple and allegedly raped her repeatedly in Thane.  The girl also revealed that Nambiar threatened her of dire consequences if she dared to disclose the matter to anyone.  Her parents got to know about the incident when she got pregnant. The accused has been charged under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He was produced before a local magistrate yesterday who remanded him in police custody till September 11, Kadam said.  Earlier, the Sena faced flak after it came out in support of senior IPS officer Sunil Paraskar, accused of raping a city-based model, and stroked a controversy by issuing a statement that it has become a 'fashion' to charge men with rape.
2706	2015-03-10 00:00:00	mob lynching with the help of Police officials and supported by powerful corrupt leaders is seeing the light of the day in India. Shame on Shiv Sena !
2707	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Who are you to preach on this? You're whining bcos a muslim was lynched. You didn't whine about the mob lynching when a mob burnt alive and christian pregnant woman and her husband alive in a brick kiln!! Get lost from here you f**king paki isi troll
2708	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I love you true Indian , help make India stable
2709	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Get those ants out of your ahole....
2710	2015-03-10 00:00:00	That shows the IQ of these RSS people. People who have glass houses must not throw stones on others , but RSS is low in IQ, they do not get it , ModiJi
2711	2015-03-10 00:00:00	blah blah blah, go preach this to you friends in isi to stop the lynchings in pakistan frist then worry about India.
2712	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This lynching is only for outsiders and not for insiders of SS.
2713	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Lets execute him immediately.
2714	2015-03-10 00:00:00	There was news that the girl was not raped, it was a conspiracy. This girl was sister in law of the rapist. I am not supporting the rapist, but this another story making rounds.
2715	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I appreciate it too... where Kanoon fails, people react and Looks like media and kongress       are all against Hindu community...
2716	2015-03-10 00:00:00	duffer, there is an innocent person killed in the most heart wrenching form by it's own citizens and you spouting wild stuff from your mouth.
2717	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Appreciate they want to fallow muslim lAW-----The Sena also demanded a stringent law, under which those found guilty of rape would be hanged within a month of committing the crime.
2718	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This is non-sense from Shiv Sena
2719	2015-03-10 00:00:00	agree complete non sense...SENA has lost since  BAL THACKREY was down
2720	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Release of jihadis by J&amp;K govt. in which Modi Ji's party is almost equal stake holder is correct? Does it make so much sense to you?
2721	2015-03-10 00:00:00	BJP has already condemmed the release
2722	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The rape accused should also have been let off with condemnation since his crime is relatively smaller.
2723	2015-03-10 00:00:00	does that mean he should be killed...do not forget he was only accused. I can accuse you tomorrow of rape...but you will be guilty only when proven..
2724	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I am also saying that he ought not to have been killed because rape after conviction is also not punishable with death.
2725	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SS has expressed the feeling of majority of people
2726	2015-03-10 00:00:00	OMG, is this what majority of people want? Remember, he was only accused. Why do civilized countries have courts? The guilt has to be proven with evidence. Any angry jilted girlfriend can accuse an innocent man of rape. How do we protect innocent persons from being falsely punished?? Dear India, we have laws which need to be followed. Any one of us can be falsely accused or by mistaken identity.
2727	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Seems, Shiv Sena took consent from morons like you.
2728	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yes, this majority want serial rapist Asaram hanged by his peanut till his death. How come he is not hanged by BJP Govt, instead being allowed to live till murder of all witnesses.
2729	2015-03-10 00:00:00	being a political party it is shameful for them to do this.. what happens when medicals come out and say there was no rape or this guy was not the real culprit. The accused has two brothers in Indian Army, other one died in Kargil war...highly unlikely for a person from such background to do such an act.
2730	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Thorough study must be conducted with the help of foreign countries for the real reasons of rape happenings in India and why not in many developed countries in the world?
2731	2015-03-09 00:00:00	There is no such place on earth where rapes don't happen. Imagine a story and you will find it. Look up Josef Fritzl case to start with.  Media has made India look like land of rapists, all though statistically India is way below other countries. Western media say Indian statistics can not be held viable as most cases go unreported. True to an extent but nothing can be concluded.
2732	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Sorry to say but India is becoming a land of rapists, look at the recent statistics in India.
2733	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You live in fools paradise. There are more rapes inthe ratio of population in Developed countries compared to India
2734	2015-03-09 00:00:00	.it seems the valid sach is no more a valid person ! he's in the habit of a**licking the foreigners, DNA it seems !
2735	2015-03-10 00:00:00	valid sach is a loser commie or a paki isi agent. Commies have a lot of time these days and they want to break India and ISI bigots are born with hatred for India so they're natural partners.
2736	2015-03-10 00:00:00	reported rape. In India they are kept quiet by the family
2737	2015-03-10 00:00:00	same applies to other countries also, not all rapes get reported due to various pressures. door knob, nincompoop, imbecile, paki jihadi musla isi troll. keep your mouth shut bcos everytime u  open it, only sh1t comes out.
2738	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Oh fool, do the simple math before you write an incoherent comment
2739	2015-03-10 00:00:00	You're back again you imbecile paki isi troll. You want some more thrashings? Randee ki aulad.
2740	2015-03-09 00:00:00	what a stupid comment about the study...??? the rapist and the rogues should be hanged within 30 days...trial or no trial... if the action is not taken the police and the judge... bothe to be imprisoned...
2741	2015-03-10 00:00:00	through study must be conducted on your brain to see how much has been left after getting brainwashed with your jihadi teachings, u effing moron disgrace to humanity.
2742	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Our country law is Justice delayed but not denied. That's sad as nobody wants to correct law which is 60yrs old only Amend it. Yes Sena is correct and such harsh and quick punishment should be given by court of law. First they should castrate the male organ then hang the culprit.
2743	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I prefer your suggestion to castrate and let mim live the life of shame
2744	2015-03-09 00:00:00	All rape victims approve the Dimapur treatment of rapists. SS are absolutely right to justify the action.
2745	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why Vasudev was not lynched ??

2746	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I guess it is justified what people have done in Nagaland. When our pathetic judicial system can't punish the criminals, people will be forced to make their own judgements. Its pathetic that such criminals are not scared of our judicial system and even 4-year girl gets raped in India.
2747	2015-03-09 00:00:00	After 10 such incidents no body will dare to rape
2748	2015-03-10 00:00:00	They will , they will just kill the women
2749	2015-03-10 00:00:00	u would know because you have experience of this from pakistan
2750	2015-03-10 00:00:00	That's how Aisha died by ur MohaMAD....
2751	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yes, this majority want serial rapist Asaram hanged by his peanut till his death. How come he is not hanged by BJP Govt, instead being allowed to live till murder of all witnesses. Agreed?
2752	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SS as well as millions are fully supportive of the Dimapur treatment of rapists. Well done SS.
2753	2015-03-09 00:00:00	When Govt fails..Ppl need to do such things..I go wid Shiv Sena
2754	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Lol, need shiv sena and mafia-goons where Govt fails to deliver law and order.
2755	2015-03-10 00:00:00	terrorists like you should also be dealt with
2756	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Aisha was raped at seven years of age
2757	2015-03-10 00:00:00	lundwaan pimp raam used to fucck and rape a 5 yr old sita till he can....later ram became 100% eunuch gandu and dats y sita ran to lanka to get sexx from raavan...raavan gave nice orals to sita as he had 10 heads... hijda jealous ram couldnt see it and begged flying langoors hanooman to get her back...TRUE STORY...further tera lundwaaaan pimp krishna supposedly had 16000 wives still he used to fucck cows and steal their cum and eat and dats y u call him maakhan chor and cows ur maaata…radha saw this chutiyapa of Krishna and dats y she never married him and preferred to stay wid him like a sIut...!!! hahahahaha :D
2758	2015-03-10 00:00:00	They were never law abiding people...They have harassed non-Maharashtra people in their state. We do support their sentiments, that locals should get jobs and preference. But, as per Indian constitution, every India has got the right to leave in any part of the country, as Shiv Sena got the right to talk about anything underneath the sun in any state, they should know that everybody has got the right to speak, profess and practice any religion and also has got the right to own property anywhere in India. They are very parochial and bigoted. Their supporting the incident at Dhmapur is wrong. Nobody has got right to take law into their hands. There is law and order authority which will take care of the matters. A responsible political party like Shiv Sena should not support such acts. To rape women is a heinous crime, but there is law which will take its own course of action. Mob fury is always dangerous in the democracy. The people who were part of the chaotic mob who indulged in the crime of lynching will definitely repent, when they think over the matter after the heat and dust has settled over the issue. But they will have to take the blame and will have to through the process of law for the crime of lynching a person, dragging him from the custody of police. Anything done in frenzy will have repercussions.
2759	2015-03-10 00:00:00	well stated !
2760	2015-03-10 00:00:00	mob fury is dangerous so apply that logic and teach it to isi cowards who can't control mob lynching in pakistan since u r an isi troll.
2761	2015-03-10 00:00:00	the problem is - what if the accused in Maharashtra is a Marathi. would SS then justify this? No. Note that the beating was a case of racism as the accused was a Muslim Bangladeshi and the victim was a local girl. this will never happen if the accused is of the same caste as the local community. people need to be intolerant to rapes irrespective of the accused's caste...then we can truly say that people have awakened....
2762	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Agreed. However, accused in this case was not Bangladeshi. His father was in armed forces.
2763	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The act was justified only if he was proved guilty and not arrested., but he was simply accused and was in Central Jail. Hence this act is not justified at all
2764	2015-03-09 00:00:00	whatever it may be but y giving him Bangladeshi tag how can an bangla residents work in Indian army his father was working in Indian air force his brothers r working in Indian army n one of his brother has given his life fighting for India but other statement by the ss that the rapist should be hanged is correct but this case is different medical reports r still awaited now keep ur words as hang our vice president nambair who is accused of raping 15yrs old girl do u dare n still there r thousands of rapist against whom charges have been already proved n they r roaming freely so many so called spiritual babas r caught in rape what about them
2765	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Senas/RSS/VHP/Sanghs, etc. all think in the same way - goondas and bullies forcing people to change their way of life under threat of violence. Rule of law is simply an afterthought - if it come to mind at all.
2766	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I agree with you ,  Goonda Laws ,
2767	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is because Shiv Sena is first and foremost a Mob , bunch of lawless violent goons. There is no surprise in them supporting one of their likes and more particularly the one who was lynched was called Syed Farid Khan.
2768	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yes, in self-defence they can be very dangerous goons. Goons are needed to counter the muslim goons who are oppressing hindus and non-muslims in many parts of India.
2769	2015-03-10 00:00:00	very well stated !
2770	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why NOT Asaram Bapu and Santhosh Madhavan ?????
2771	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Whatever happened was not correct. But taking more than 20 years to decide a case of serious crimes is also not correct.
2772	2015-03-09 00:00:00	That was absolutely correct
2773	2015-03-09 00:00:00	that's the way rapist should be taught a lesson. keep thy sympathies to thy self. hang them for their crime. the shiv sena will do the same to all rapist now, be careful.
2774	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Hanging their vice president Nambiar?
2775	2015-03-10 00:00:00	SS being a political party it is shameful for them to do this.. what happens when medicals come out and say there was no rape or this guy was not the real culprit. The accused has two brothers in Indian Army, other one died in Kargil war...highly unlikely for a person from such background to do such an act.
2776	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Not to mention the accused was businessman from Assam. Nagaland and Assam have always been enemies..its like relation of MNS and bihari students
2777	2015-03-10 00:00:00	WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ELECT THE SHIV SENA TO OFFICE?
2778	2015-03-10 00:00:00	For once I agree with Shiv Sena. Rapists should be killed within 30 days of crime being committed.
2779	2015-03-10 00:00:00	'CELIBATE’ SHIV SENA LEADER ACCUSED OF RAPE HAS OVER 23 MAJOR CASES AGAINST HIM.
2780	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Such jingoism coming from the leaders of the most modern city in India speaks volume - i wonder the world watching would want their people to set foot on Indian soil.
2781	2015-03-10 00:00:00	No to lynching and breaking the law, yes take steps to speed up trials for quick and efficient justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. The same justi e should be meeted out to leadership of SSand MNS as well for destroying property .
2782	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Marathas dont have the courage
2783	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Someone needs to lynch uddhav Thackeray too
2784	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The Shiv Sena wants to get cheap publicity whenever and wherever possible. They are better left to clear up their mess themselves
2785	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Mr. Ram Kadam, start this lynching law from your party first. Drag Vasudev nambiar out of the jail, treat him the same way the mob treated, then start bluffing in your party mouthpiece alias newspaper.  In a major embarrassment for Shiv Sena, the party's 62-year-old deputy president Vasudev Nambiar has been arrested for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl for the past many months, as per reports on Sunday.   According to the police, the matter came to light when the victim delivered a premature baby at a local hospital in Mira Road. On questioning she revealed that she was being raped by Nambiar since January.  The accused took the girl out several times with him on the pretext of visit to the temple and allegedly raped her repeatedly in Thane.  The girl also revealed that Nambiar threatened her of dire consequences if she dared to disclose the matter to anyone.  Her parents got to know about the incident when she got pregnant. The accused has been charged under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He was produced before a local magistrate yesterday who remanded him in police custody till September 11, Kadam said.  Earlier, the Sena faced flak after it came out in support of senior IPS officer Sunil Paraskar, accused of raping a city-based model, and stroked a controversy by issuing a statement that it has become a 'fashion' to charge men with rape.
2786	2015-03-10 00:00:00	If this statement comes from the mouth of Aditya Thackrey then it is a problematic and concerning but it it is from some other person/s then nothing serious because they have been proponents of mob justice since their beginning.
2787	2015-03-09 00:00:00	What can we expect more than this from lynching specialists Shiv Sena ?
2788	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The crowd of 10000 has killed the rapist, which is bad in the law. but if we have look to the pending cases, which are hanging for the last many years,the people have  no option.The real problem lies in our judicial system.The Delhi Govt. run by the AAP party is going to form  fast track court,(for women) providing the law which bind the court to deliver the judgement within six months.The Central Govt. should also make law for every court to deliver the judgement within six months.The person investigating the case should be responsible for any delay and have punishment provision for police too.
2789	2015-03-09 00:00:00	A professor in Germany on Monday apologised for refusing an Indian male student an internship because of his country's "rape problem", after the German ambassador to India condemned the incident.
2790	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Lynching is not right why do we have systems in place if we take the law into our own hands. Are we any better than those people?
2791	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If this is justfied,then why condemn ISIS,TALIBAN,and other barbarians!
2792	2015-03-10 00:00:00	well said !
2793	2015-03-09 00:00:00	In this way all shiv sena leaders blamed to be responsible for Mumbai roits and killing of Muslim must have been drawn into streets and burnt alive by mob.This way will lead to anarchy.If we are going back to 10th century.
2794	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This man is a Choos.The Guy was just arrested on a FIR complaint lodged by the complainant..However It was not medically proven when Public reacted with that Guy in such a Barbaric Manner... There are many incidence where Innocent men have been framed by Women just to avenge for any reason... Hang the culprit if it is Medically proven..but no action before that
2795	2015-03-09 00:00:00	How can one be sure if someone is actually a culprit. that's why there is a judicial system. Instead of doing this why can't Government take steps so that the courts will give the judgement in as quick as possible.

2797	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Gunda Sena will preach and protect their own way
2798	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This is Shiv Sena type action- mob vengeance passing for justice. It helps that in this case, the accused is for their No.1 enemy- a minority community person.
2799	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Which such stup!d statements, no wonder their own people did not elect them and have beenout of power for a very long time.
2800	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Put your sister in place of that girl and than think. Also stop going cinema to clap on such scenes of Hero.
2801	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is a perfect statement Let this happen to your wife sister or daughter and give your statement
2802	2015-03-09 00:00:00	THATS WHY THEIR IS HARSHER PUNISHMENT IS THERE FOR RAPIST TOO IN ISLAM, BUT THAT TIME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
2803	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SO you want to bring ISIS. Go and ask rape case handling in Pakistan tribal area and they will tell you as how do they punish raped girl and rapist. They will also tell you differential punishment in adultary and education to female folks, their veils etc. And it has been medieval Arab laws which is being tried to be adopted in today times without any application of mind.
2804	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Kettle calling the pot black, Lol.
2805	2015-03-10 00:00:00	what Lol? u f*cking paki isi troll, keep your nose off from where it doesn't belong.
2806	2015-03-10 00:00:00	What do you mean by that. Should learn to introspect rather than irrational counterattcking
2807	2015-03-09 00:00:00	They are wrong when they justify what happened in Nagaland..but their demand that the culprits who are rapists should be sentenced to death in a month after committing the offence is in order...
2808	2015-03-09 00:00:00	why do you clap on the moves of hero on the screen? If she was your sister, were you have been so humble and would have hired a lawyer to wait for 10 years
2809	2015-03-09 00:00:00	sena absolutely right. but they should not just talk but drag rapists on the streets and lynch too
2810	2015-03-10 00:00:00	so what are you waiting for, drag Vasudev Nambiar on the street and lynch him.
2811	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Many in the country believe this way in the absence of delay in timely justice!!!! Unless there is improvement in judiciary, these incidents can't be avoided.......
2812	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Agree
2813	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The statement shows the arrogance of Sena... Thinking....
2814	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You want rapist to be garlanded and given Bharat Ratna
2815	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Don't you clap on the moves of hero on the screen? If she was your sister, were you have been so humble and would have hired a lawyer to wait for 10 years

2818	2015-03-10 00:00:00	While I agree that our judicial system is slow, there is no place in our society for people who take law in their own hands.  Yes, it is frustrating that people can harm other people, their sentiments, their economies and go unpunished due to their "connections", but we should refrain from such extreme violence.
2819	2015-03-10 00:00:00	One thing we all agree is that the judiciary system is too slow. Why dont the anchors start a debate on how to speed up the judicial system. Make the judges and lawyers accountable for delay. So many cases are pending. We need to serious think on how to tackle this issue. Justice delayed is justice denied. This is a blot on our confidence in the governance. We feel completely unprotected by law as people prefer to settle things outside the courtrooms giving rise to corruption. This is a threat to our morality as well. Everybody wants to move on in life. Bribing today seems a better option rather than doing the rounds of courts for 15-20 years.
2820	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Yes i totally agree with him, if there is no punishment then nobody would care. You know its in our blood.
2821	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Shiv Sena is a right wing Hindutava party and will always justify and defend killing of minorities.
2822	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Shiv Sena is attention seeker. Ignore them.
2823	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The accused who was lynched has two brothers in Indian Army, other one died in Kargil war. He is not bangladeshi...bad thing is no one knows whether he actually raped the girl or not.. CCTV shows girl went in hotel after the guy. Instant justice is good but what happens when girls just frame the guy.
2824	2015-03-10 00:00:00	as per people , it is simple justice and no one should object punishment for henious crime as justice for the people by the people, but as per established system of law  it is crime to take law in hand .
2825	2015-03-10 00:00:00	First time Sena is talking sensible facts and demands!
2826	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The lynching shows people anger at the lax justice redressal mechanism in the country. We need immediate reforms in laws. Cases should be dealt on fast track basis. The accused should be asked to prove his innocence, police and medical officer should also be made accountable if they do not submit their report within 24-48 hours of the incident. If proven guilty, the rapists should be given capital punishments.
2827	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Agree. Lets give Padma Shree to People involved in giving justice in this case. Lets have immediate Death Sentence for Rapists India Wide.
2828	2015-03-10 00:00:00	There we go again. Everything needs to be fixed.....including the attitude.
2829	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Law of Jungle.
2830	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Every MAN will support this, to hell with those who wants to hide there faces in laws and rules
2831	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I watched India's Daughter on CBC, Canada last night., and shocked resulting sleepless night.
2832	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The real culprit is the judicial system which works at a snail's pace.
2833	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Indian justice system is makes hell to this country it is itself a punishment for innocent people, look how cruelly this system of criminals looting torturing people.
2834	2015-03-10 00:00:00	#Absolutely correct. I support 110%
2835	2015-03-10 00:00:00	bold views!! appreciate it
2836	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Hurriyat leaders and PDP men who are raping their mother land should also be lynched.
2837	2015-03-10 00:00:00	I agree with SS. Now SS should lynch rapists in Naina Pujari rape case too.
2838	2015-03-10 00:00:00	How dare somebody rape? Such criminals must be killed immediately.
2839	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Rapists do not have any right to live any more. Government must take action against criminals against women as soon as possible without any intentional delay.
2840	2015-03-10 00:00:00	yahoooooo. at this column I justified this crowd justice. shiv sena did it too. political group like shiv sena needed in Bengal to keep a strict tab over dirty nasty forces like Kolkata Police
2841	2015-03-10 00:00:00	what about blue film rajas of bjp and who attempt to rape friends wife, this is show this the bjp's real face are you think women are safe in modi government who looted karnataka and andra now they are free to roam and with teh bjp this is called clean government
2842	2015-03-10 00:00:00	justice delayed is justice denied. it's time our politicians and judiciary understands the frustration of the people before this mob justice becomes a norm.
2843	2015-03-10 00:00:00	In nagaland he supports the lyncing before proven guilty, whereas in maharastra he wants the man to be proven guilty the punished.
2844	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Finaly S S HAS THE GUTS AND SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE
2845	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Our judicial system works at a snail's pace when it comes to rape cases. However strong the case may be, we can never be sure if the rapist will be hanged. And if the accused is a minor, he is sent to a remand home where in the name of humanity, all kinds of facilities are provided to him," it said.
2846	2015-03-09 00:00:00	SS is absolutely right in  its observation and when the courts failed to deliver justice people must take the law into their hands to teach the courts of their shoddy way of working and lenient always to wards the culprits .This should happen in all states as believing corrupt courts is a foolish thing now a days.
2847	2015-03-10 00:00:00	SS-mafia is provoking the common man to take law in their own hands so what's preventing them dragging people like Vasudev Nambiar and lynching them.
2848	2015-03-09 00:00:00	According to me 2 options... Either Kill the accused within a month or the judge for taking his own sweet time... Either way... Justice will get delivered...  The next judge that come to try the same case will ensure justice is delivered in 30 days...
2849	2015-03-09 00:00:00	1st Stand Taken By SS - Which will e supported by pan India...
2850	2015-03-09 00:00:00	If one or two such incidents happen in rest of India, particularly Delhi, the youth of this country will be cured of their "raping mentality". What justice the rapists are following, that the courts and governments should take utmost care to do justice, with the result that the rapists are lodged in jails, and government feeds them free food, at public expense. That is why the rape cases have not abated so far. Confirmed rapists should be given swift and exemplary punishment. Then only we can see some change in our society.
2851	2015-03-09 00:00:00	LYNCHING BY MOB.  IT IS AN INDICATION OF PEOPLES FRUSTRATION AND SUFFOCATION IN THE MINDS    WHICH HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO A VIOLENT ACT.  FOR THE PAST 65 THE CITIZENS HAVE BEEN TOTALLY NEGLECTED AND THEIR REQTS. HAVE BEEN UNCARED  IT IS A SPONTANEOUS REACTION AND REMEMBER THAT MORNING  SHOWS THE DAY.  THIS MAY BE THE START OF A REVOLUTION IN THE DAYS TO COME.  THE GOVT. AND THE POLITICAL LEADERS WILL TRY TO SNUB THIS MINI REVOLUTION FIRMLY AS THEY ALL THINK OF THEIR GAINS ONLY.
2852	2015-03-09 00:00:00	In Singapore , culprit is executed on the 30th day of commiting a crime( be it rape or murder) . That's y crime rate is zero.
2853	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Im in total agreement with then
2854	2015-03-09 00:00:00	rapist Bangladeshi got the right punishment.
2855	2015-03-09 00:00:00	This will deter othet rapists.
2856	2015-03-09 00:00:00	u know looking at d way our law and order deals with rapists.i think what happend  was right ..
2857	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I actually  agree with these ppl on something
2858	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Being prudent and being Shiv Sena Chief are poles apart.
2859	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Great u want to fallow Muslim law-------The Sena also demanded a stringent law, under which those found guilty of rape would be hanged within a month of committing the crime.
2860	2015-03-09 00:00:00	half Brother of ISIS
2861	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No wonder about SS comment as they even Praise the Assassin of Mahatma Gandhi ...!!!
2862	2015-03-10 00:00:00	They mirror ISIS idealogy
2863	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No value of their rubish and outdated thiught
2864	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I totally agree with Shiv Sena on this.
2865	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Let us try to be apolitical and think of the situation where your mother, sister, wife or daughter gets raped. What will be your response ? I suggest, do not kill but burn the genitals of the rapist or a potential rapist. Let us have such person live in shame like the one whose modesty is outraged. Change in law and change in punishment is required. Prison term or death are inadequate.
2866	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Totally agree with this perfect judgement. Relying on indian judiciary is like waiting to buy a house on moon.  Other states should follow this justice system. Its fast and furious.
2867	2015-03-09 00:00:00	this is the first time I support their views !!
2868	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It's true that trial must be speady and loopholes of law must not be allowed to use to delay and deny justice to rape victims.
2869	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Many many many many thanks to Shiv Sena. At-least one organization we found who appreciated this act openly. Till date I noticed only public in thi.s forum appreciated. For the first time one political party is also appreciating this. Once again - thanks to Shiv Sena
2870	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Frankly speaking, death punishment is not preferable over life imprisonment for rape. Sometimes the cases are filed purposely to blackmail the man and to harass him. It takes a long time to prove that the case was false.
2871	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Why Vasudev Nambiar was not lynched??

2872	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Muzzies are the ones protesting against the mob attack - !!! Porks will be porks --- if the victim was ur sister/friend ?? Wont muzzies want to punish him via sharia law cutting him into parts as done in saudi ???? --- i dont often go by SS but support them in this
2873	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I think it was a good statement from SS who are talking on behalf of millions of people. Our judiciary needs to take a notice of that because people are losing faith in judiciary
2874	2015-03-09 00:00:00	first time I fully agree with shiv sena on this subject. because our legel system is too slow to punish anyone, the rapes are on the increase. even if the culprit is proved guilty he can enjoy in the prison or come out on bail and rape some more. yes, how dare this bangladeshi comes and rapes indian woman. who allowed him to come for vote bank politics. God save this country.
2875	2015-03-09 00:00:00	With due respect, when that rape accused's father got martyred in Kargil no body doubted his nationality. Two of his brothers are still serving Indian Army. Ironically, It has become a fashion to quickly brand someone as pakistani, bangladeshi or traitor, specially when she/he belong to a particular religion. Rape is a heinous crime. Lets not mix politics with it.
2876	2015-03-09 00:00:00	people react in this fashion when law takes too long a time. Justice cannot be prolonged. Look at the Nirbhaya case. In spite of a nation protesting, the legal system cannot conclude a case that has so much evidence. One of the accused has come in front of the world looking like a hero in a sensational television interview. If not for the ban imposed by the Indian government, the interview could indeed create a record of sort of the highest viewership on social media. I am shocked not by the lynching but by the lack of legal protection for the common man and woman.
2877	2015-03-10 00:00:00	And that's what the difference between most emotionally blinded Indians and people from developed world - that "most likes" on social media doesn't make an evil-doer, a hero. If anything, exposes the evil-doers engrained mentality.
2878	2015-03-09 00:00:00	All rape victims must get justice within a time frame. Justice late is justice denial.
2879	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The lynching was absolutely right.This criminals needs instant justice, like Gangajaal type. Good job done
2880	2015-03-09 00:00:00	The act can be justified under humanity but not under law -- law says to file a case and jail him ,, then feed money and get bail and roam freely ---- sickular judiciary !! SS are correct by their statements -!-! At times we have to set our emotions first -- mob attack is justifyable  !!!!
2881	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I see many ppl supporting lynching. should muslim lynch maya kondani?  she is convicted mass murderer and is roaming free.
2882	2015-03-09 00:00:00	its not everyday i agree with ss but today i do public did the right thing delhi ppl should try this
2883	2015-03-09 00:00:00	sena would have said the same if marathi manoos got lynched in other state?  they supported marathi molester during new year incident. do no mistake they are 2 headed snake and should be crushed.
2884	2015-03-09 00:00:00	It is not Shiv Sena but a general public sentiment. Criticize SS for all wrong action, but also support the correct action. Can you tell as whether the mob action is correct or not? Whether our polical leadership and judiciary should not hang their heads in shame for mockery of justice being done by them
2885	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Every rapist should get a death like this...
2886	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Gogoi is trying to save the moslem vote bank in Assam.Nothing else.
2887	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You should move an amendment to CrPC to the effect that rape accused can be punished the way the dead has been. What if he is really not involved is not answered by any of those supporting the action. Additionally, assuming that he is guilty, has not been given a punishment that is not there in the Cr P C? May his soul rest in peace.
2888	2015-03-09 00:00:00	You may treat it as contempt of court, but such cases should be solved in less than three or six months. In case they are still open, the sitting judge, the PP and the lead police officer should be included as co-accused. I don't know whether it leads to false convictions or not, but it is worth a try.
2889	2015-03-09 00:00:00	one to three months maximum fansi within 6 monthe
2890	2015-03-09 00:00:00	Some punishment, but it should come swift...
2891	2015-03-09 00:00:00	public has done justice   its a good job .
2892	2015-03-09 00:00:00	now this is the reason for shiv senas performance in loksabha election.. they wont do anything to improve the law but wants to take law in own hands.. people of maharashtra are not mad to follow them.
2893	2015-03-09 00:00:00	A corrupt administration who allowed mob to dragged out prisoner for killing can't be trusted on his assertion that first medical report proving deceased innocent was wrong and latterly manipulated report is right for showing killing acceptable and mitigate the charge of criminal negligence. It is also worth=noting that for mobilizing the mob against the deceased they laid emphasis for being Bangladeshi Muslim instead of crime. The fact is that the deceased had refused to pay Rs.250000/-  extortion money for opening a shop. His refusal led to this dire consequence. It means that police is itself involved to get lion share of extortion money. This whole scenario is enough to speak the plight of Muslims in India where anybody may be declared Bangladeshi for the ransom money at the hands of callous Hindu extremists who justify tyranny over Muslims.
2894	2015-03-09 00:00:00	They were Nagas and Christians. Now you can start complaining Christian extremist to nurse your problems. Are you Bangla Deshi illegal immigrant to complain so? It is one of the strangest logic.
2895	2015-03-09 00:00:00	No wonder Shiv Sena got as many elected representatives the last elections.

2939	2015-02-21 00:00:00	Muslims vs Christians Muslims vs Jews Muslims vs Hindus Muslims vs Buddhist Muslims vs Sikhs Why is Islam anti and fighting with all the religions?
2940	2015-02-21 00:00:00	Muslim openly endorse the butcher committed by ISIS, school girls abducted and molested by Boko Haram, daily suicide bombings done by Taliban, persecution of Hindus and Sikhs in Kashmir, torture of Jews in Israel, ethnic cleansing of Buddhists in Myanmar and many other things. This is because our great religion Islam endorses that. However, Muslim openly denounce the retaliation by Hindus in Godhra, the hit back by Buddhists in Myanmar, the retribution by Israel even though we have incited the trouble.
2941	2015-02-21 00:00:00	And what have they achieved by bomb blasts? Why dont they involve into constructive ideas than destructive? Pathetic attitude of some people really.
2942	2015-02-24 00:00:00	just bcoz of these kind of people the whole Muslim community is seen as terrorists, Muslims themselves should take initiative to clean these kind of virus from our society to have a clear image atleast for the upcoming next generation, it's now or never decide for urself
2943	2015-02-25 00:00:00	Why such soft sentence? WHy not hang them or shoot them. We cant go too soft on terror. Death can only be the punishment for any activities involving terror.
2944	2015-02-24 00:00:00	The UPA government was consistent in denying the existence, role and link with external entities, of terrorists bodies. Nor the fact of training with Wahabian promotion fund from Saudi Arabia was  acceded. Ever in denial mode if an issue involved minorities.
2945	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Because of a controversial building,these people find it justifiable to kill innocent Hindus with the blessings of the Muslim community. Islam is poisonous and should be banned.
2946	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Why not death sentence? Because when these people come out, they would be even hardcore criminals with lot of links. Their objective has been to disturb peace in our country and they will do it no matter what the punishment is. Best is feed them to animals in Vandalur zoo.
2947	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Absolutely, I agree with you dear.
2948	2015-02-24 00:00:00	when people stop all this.
2949	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Why are we being lenient with people who plot to bomb. They should be dealt with by the Military, and disposed as seemed fit. It doesnt matter which community.
2950	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Very True!! Absolutely, I agree with you dear.
2951	2015-02-24 00:00:00	10 year RI is too lenient for the filth.
2952	2015-02-24 00:00:00	ur cmmnt also good aashish
2953	2015-02-24 00:00:00	so ur telling persons who demolished t babri are good people. U don't link Muslims with terrorism. Muslims force showed their anger in a wrong way, in that time, that's all.
2954	2015-01-26 00:00:00	Every State which has a Non-Hindu Majority Population is seeking freedom from India.
2955	2015-01-26 00:00:00	You wish! Why don't you worry about Pakistan? Your home grown terrorists are now blowing up your own transmission towers. 80% of the country is without power today. You reap what you sow! I suggest you STOP your hate propaganda and get a life! India is a secular country unlike Pakistan. What happened to the Hindus in Pakistan? In 1947 you had 22% Hindus, now they are less than 1%. On the other hand, India had 7% Muslims in 1947 and now they are 18% of the total population. Pakistan must be held accountable for genocide of its minority. You l0sers have no right to talk about India.
2956	2015-01-26 00:00:00	Manipur must be given a choice to decide between India and Independence.
2957	2015-01-26 00:00:00	anyone protesting / boycotting national day should be prosecuted as anti national .
2958	2015-01-26 00:00:00	We have to track the criminals and punish them.Emulate France
2959	2015-01-26 00:00:00	What a non sense like news, if there were 8 blast 5 days before of republic day then why news coming today on the eve of 26th January, if news was blackout due to security reason then there is no point to disclose such a news on the eve of republic day.  If news is fresh and blast took place on the occasion of republic day and if there were any report of boycott  of republic day functions, then there is no point to provide the news stuff with old label, if there is any resentment in the public for the national festival try to sort out the problem rather to hide the fact.
2960	2015-03-31 00:00:00	looks like a secular bomb. so it is OK. It could just be nitish and company preparing for elections.

2965	2015-03-31 00:00:00	The Income Tax department on Tuesday took to the strategy of 'naming and shaming' of some large tax defaulters as it published names of 18 entities who owe over Rs 500 crore tax to the exchequer.
2966	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Without publication of the names of illegal or otherwise occupiers of the flat, the news cannot be complete.

2976	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Ridiculous to see how easy to make bombs these days. Just about all ingredients can be easily purchased from the market.
2977	2015-03-31 00:00:00	CM, Sir are you reading these comments? Are we sliding back to jungle raj of which you were so against? Sir do you recall in Macbeth, regarding perfume of Arabia?
2978	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Station house officer of Agamkuan police station Vinay Sharma said the flat in which the explosion took place was under illegal possession of a youth.
2979	2015-03-31 00:00:00	What a great national news! I think it was a cooking gas cylinder explosion. The kitchen window was open, some monkeys came in, played with the gas regulator and then the explosion. Since then, the DGP has issued a warning that all kitchen windoors should be closed when nobody is at home.
2980	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Cops need to investigation further and find the person behind this, good to hear that there were no causalities
2981	2015-03-31 00:00:00	The house must be of ABVP &amp; RSS member. All RSS, BJP memebrs must be arrested and interogated, it's a matter of national Safety. RSS must be doing it like they did it in the past in MAKKAH MASJID BLAST, MALEGAON BLAST, SAMJHAUTA EXPRESS BLAST AND PUNE BLAST, in order to communally divide the society and win. BJP &amp; RSS are frustrated seeing the true lehar of them and Modi in recent Delhi election, where they win only 3 seats out of 70.
2982	2015-04-01 00:00:00	This is exactly the complete psycological slavery to Arabs. The Arab culture is famous for its concept of pride. Image is very important and pride and shame are great motivators. Protecting the image of Muslims in front of the non-Muslim World is vital. Thus elaborate behavior is done to saving face. Admitting to a mistake can bring terrible shame and is not regarded as a virtue; those who admit to mistakes are not rewarded for their honesty but ridiculed and shamed or even severely punished. ... Fear of being accused of defaming one's tribe, nation or religion leads to a culture that tends to blame others rather than look within. ... There is also a concept in Islam called "taqueya" which allows lying to non-Muslims if it is in the best interest of Islam. That concept is very deep in Muslim culture that we don't even think of the term "taqueya" any more; it has simply penetrated every aspect of Muslim life. Because of it there is very little self-criticism. Thus, saying sorry, admitting guilt or looking within for solutions is not a strong value; it will surely get a person in deep trouble instead. Such a person will bear the blunt of the blame for everything - even for what he did not do; thus you have Muslim denials and defensiveness over matters that many in the West cannot comprehend. ... Shaming is prominent in the Arab child. To avoid the intense pain of shaming, denying responsibility turns into a virtue to save face and protect one's pride. The concept of "taqueya" is one of the reasons many Muslims were silent after 9/11. Only a few were speaking out honestly and openly by admitting there is a problem in Muslim culture that needs to be examined and corrected. The few Arab Americans who did that where not rewarded for their honesty by their Muslim community; instead they were condemned, shunned and shamed by the majority of Muslims. ... This charade of denials and games has done nothing but keep the Muslim world in a permanent state of stagnation, turmoil and poverty despite of the wealth from oil."

2984	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Must be a Muslim. Bombs and Islam are interrelated.
2985	2015-03-31 00:00:00	The house must be of ABVP &amp; RSS member. All RSS, BJP memebrs must be arrested and interogated, it's a matter of national Safety.

2991	2015-03-31 00:00:00	My question is what was the bomb doing in a residential apartment. That needs to be investigated first.
2992	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Looks similar to Khagragar (WB) blast which NIA is currently probing
2993	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Ousted Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Prashant Bhushan has indicated to form a new political party after he and Yogendra Yadav were expelled from the national executive.  According to reports, all the volunteers will meet on April 14 to take a concrete decision over the matter. The meeting is expected to be attended by several members of the party's national executive and national council.  Earlier on Saturday, Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were ousted from the party's national executive.      Out of the 311 national executive members present in yesterday's national council meeting, an overwhelming 247 members voted against Bhushan and Yadav while just 8 votes were cast in their favour.  The party also removed Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha from the national executive.  The party's internal rift had widened after Yadav and Bhushan were accused of working for party's defeat during the Delhi Assembly polls last month.
2994	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Bihar sliding back to Jungle raaj of Lalu Yadav days!
2995	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Agreed ....sad part is the entire country will follow too
2996	2015-03-31 00:00:00	No problem. The Jangal raj political group  will ensure that future Bihar will blast high intensity bomb only. The criminal will get free hand to blast good quality of bomb any where in Bihar including the capital.
2997	2015-03-31 00:00:00	WHAT ELSE ONE CAN EXPECT FROM BIHAR State
2998	2015-03-31 00:00:00	so sad!
