\section{\uppercase{Phase 2}}
In Phase 2, we plan to conduct more concrete experiments with different variations to topic models to come up with a model that fits our domain well. Parallely, we aim to focus on modeling the evolution of detected events. To this end, we plan to work on techniques to generate event evolution graphs, and employ time-series models to predict future events. Our plan is to verify our models by running experiments on the Twitter dataset. Among other evaluation measures, we plan to observe the purity of events detected over the entire dataset and within small time windows, plot their evolution across different time windows, and validate predictions made by our model from the actual dataset.
