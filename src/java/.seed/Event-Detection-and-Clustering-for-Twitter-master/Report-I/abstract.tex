\abstract{
We describe our semester long work on event detection, tracking, and prediction on Twitter. We have presented a comprehensive survey of the available literature in this field, specially the use of topic models for detection of real-world events from Twitter posts. In particular, we discuss interesting variants of LDA proposed for topic inferences from tweets. Further, we present a brief note about our preliminary experiments with LDA on Twitter dataset. Finally, we conclude with our plan for Phase-2, wherein the major focus will be on modeling the evolution of detected events, and using this model to predict future events.
