# HelpMe!: Identifying emergency reports and calls for help on social media
> The aim of this project is to produce a series of curated feeds containing social media posts, where each feed corresponds to a particular type of information request, aid request, or report containing a particular type of information

## Background

> Internationally, civil protection, police forces and emergency response agencies are under increasing pressure to more quickly and effectively respond to emergency situations. The mass adoption of mobile internet-enabled devices paired with wide-spread use of social media platforms for communication and coordination has created ways for the public on-the-ground to contact response services.

> Moreover, a recent study reported that 63% of people expect responders to answer calls for help on social media. With the rise of social media, emergency service operators are now expected to monitor those channels and answer questions from the public However, they do not have adequate tools or manpower to effectively monitor social media, due to the large volume of information posted on these platforms and the need to categorise, cross-reference and verify that information.

> For instance, for a flash flooding event, feeds might include, ‘requests for food/water’, ‘reports of road blockages’, and ‘evacuation requests’. In this way, during an emergency, individual emergency management operators and other stakeholders can register to access to the subset of feeds within their domain of responsibility providing access to relevant social media content.

During the project the student will learn about how to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify social media posts by the information they contain in real-time.

## Technical Details
